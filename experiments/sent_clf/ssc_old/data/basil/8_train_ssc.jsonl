for future generations,\u201d Mr. Rand said.", "He made clear that the group\u2019s willingness to discuss cuts comes with conditions: Reductions in benefits should be \u201cminimal,\u201d they should not affect current recipients and instead should be directed \u201cfar off in the future,\u201d and they should be offset by increases in tax-generated revenue.", "Mr. Rother said AARP expected to hear criticism from some of its members over its position on possible cuts.", "The group\u2019s stance, which generated quick reaction from all sides because of its powerful voice on the issue, could provide added ammunition to fiscal conservatives who have sought unsuccessfully to restructure Social Security and chip away at the benefits it promises older Americans.", "While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group\u2019s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.", "\u201cWe have such a broad membership, Mr. Rother said.", "But other advocacy groups that are pushing to preserve Social Security benefits accused AARP of effectively abandoning its core constituency.", "\u201cAARP is the 800-pound gorilla, but they do not speak for seniors.\u201d", "Mr. Rother said the group\u2019s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Friday\u2019s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 AARP, the powerful lobby for older Americans that has been seen as one of the leading opponents of Social Security benefit cuts, said on Friday that it was open to modest reductions in benefits for future recipients.", "AARP insisted that the Social Security trust funds should not be raided to reduce the deficit and that the two issues were separate.", "While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security \u201cto determine how each might \u2014 individually or in different combinations \u2014 impact the lives of current and future retirees.\u201d", "\u201cOur goal is to limit any changes in benefits,\u201d John Rother, AARP\u2019s policy chief, said in a telephone interview, \u201cbut we also want to see the system made solvent.\u201d", "Nonetheless, the group\u2019s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARP\u2019s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including Medicare, prescription drugs and many more.", "\u201cYou have to look at all the tradeoffs,\u201d Mr. Rother said, \u201cand what we\u2019re trying to do is engage the American public in that debate.\u201d", "The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program\u2019s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some who will not be happy, but others will be eager to see the program put on a stronger financial footing for the long term.\u201d", "Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group in Washington, said the timing of AARP\u2019s statements was particularly bad because it came in the midst of deliberations between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans about the debt ceiling and overall deficit reduction."]}
