group\u2019s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Friday\u2019s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 AARP, the powerful lobby for older Americans that has been seen as one of the leading opponents of Social Security benefit cuts, said on Friday that it was open to modest reductions in benefits for future recipients.", "AARP insisted that the Social Security trust funds should not be raided to reduce the deficit and that the two issues were separate.", "While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security \u201cto determine how each might \u2014 individually or in different combinations \u2014 impact the lives of current and future retirees.\u201d", "\u201cOur goal is to limit any changes in benefits,\u201d John Rother, AARP\u2019s policy chief, said in a telephone interview, \u201cbut we also want to see the system made solvent.\u201d", "Nonetheless, the group\u2019s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARP\u2019s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including Medicare, prescription drugs and many more.", "\u201cYou have to look at all the tradeoffs,\u201d Mr. Rother said, \u201cand what we\u2019re trying to do is engage the American public in that debate.\u201d", "The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program\u2019s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.", "\u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some who will not be happy, but others will be eager to see the program put on a stronger financial footing for the long term.\u201d", "Max Richtman, executive vice president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group in Washington, said the timing of AARP\u2019s statements was particularly bad because it came in the midst of deliberations between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans about the debt ceiling and overall deficit reduction."]}
