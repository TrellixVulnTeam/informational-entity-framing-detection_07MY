Hillary and Bill Clinton earned roughly $141 million and paid nearly $44 million in federal income taxes from 2007 to 2014, according to tax returns released Friday.
The former secretary of state and Democratic presidential candidate released the tax returns on her campaign website, along with her health records and a list of paid speeches she and her husband gave.
According to the returns, the Clintons earned $140,937,785 over the eight year span, primarily from book sales and speaking fees.
The couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes and $13,625,777 in state and local taxes, and made $14,959,450 in charitable contributions during that time.
Last year, the Clintons paid an effective federal tax rate of 35.7 percent and donated over 10 percent of their income to charity.
"We’ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children’s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas—and we owe it to the opportunities America provides," Clinton said in a statement accompanying the returns.
"I want more Americans to have the chance to work hard and get ahead, just like we did.
And reforming the tax code can help."
The Clintons have previously released their tax returns dating back to 1977.
Clinton's release comes about one month after Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush released 33 years of returns, showing his net worth between $19 and $22 million.
Bush paid an effective tax rate of roughly 36 percent over those three decades.
In May, Hillary Clinton filed a disclosure with the Federal Elections Commission showing the couple had earned approximately $30 million from book sales and speeches in 2014 and the first four months of 2015.

Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday released her most recent eight years of tax returns, showing that she and former President Bill Clinton earned $139 million in adjusted gross income from 2007 to 2014.
She also released a list of paid speeches showing that she had earned nearly $10 million in speaking fees in 2013, the year she left the State Department.
The spate of voluntary disclosures on Friday, intended to highlight Mrs. Clinton’s efforts at transparency, came after a week of renewed attention to her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.
Recent polls suggest that the focus on Mrs. Clinton’s email practices has affected the number of voters who see her as “honest” and “trustworthy.”
In a statement, Mrs. Clinton highlighted the millions of dollars she said she and her husband had paid in taxes and given to charity, while lamenting what she called a lopsided tax code that favors wealthy people like them.
The Clintons have grown immensely better off in the 15 years since they left the White House, primarily through book deals, paid speeches and other business ventures involving Mr. Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton has devoted a fair amount of time since April, when she began her second presidential campaign, to showing she understands the needs of working-class Americans, who have not seen their wages grow in years, and those struggling in the post-recession job market.
That effort was made particularly urgent after Mrs. Clinton said last year that she and her husband were “dead broke” when they left the White House.
The remark was widely seized upon by Republicans who argued she was out of touch.
The Clintons have previously released their tax returns for the period from 1977, when they entered public life, through 2006.
The new ones show that from 2007 through 2014 the couple paid $43,885,310 in federal taxes, for an effective tax rate of 31.55 percent.
They gave nearly $15 million to charity, or an average of 10.8 percent of their earnings.
Their charitable deductions ranged from $550,000 in 2008 to more than $3 million in 2007, 2013 and 2014.
All but $190,450 of their personal charitable giving passed through their philanthropic entity, the Clinton Family Foundation, the returns show.
The beneficiaries of that foundation, which files a separate tax return, include their larger foundation ($1.865 million in 2014), as well as the Museum for African Art in New York, the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in California and the American Ireland Fund, based in New York.
Among Mrs. Clinton’s disclosures Friday was that she was paid $9.68 million in 2013 for 41 speeches, all in the United States except for two in Toronto.
She topped out at $400,000 for a speech to the Jewish United Fund/Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago.
Her standard rate was $225,000.
She gave three speeches to Goldman Sachs in 2013 and was paid a total of $675,000 for them; her husband was paid $200,000 by Goldman Sachs for a speech in New York, two days after Mrs. Clinton spoke to the bank in South Carolina, according to an accompanying list of his 2013 speaking fees.
In all, Mr. Clinton earned $13.17 million in 2013, also for 41 speeches, the most lucrative of these, at $750,000, for addressing Handelsbanken Capital Markets in Stockholm that May; Mr. Clinton listed a second payment of $100,000 from the same company the same day.
Fifteen of his speeches were abroad.
Besides the royalties from his books and his speaking fees, Mr. Clinton earned nearly $20 million between 2011 and 2014 for advising or consulting companies.
“We’ve come a long way from my days going door to door for the Children’s Defense Fund and earning $16,450 as a young law professor in Arkansas — and we owe it to the opportunities America provides,” Mrs. Clinton said in her statement.
Her aides hope to set up a favorable contrast for her with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a leading Republican contender, who has argued he is more transparent than she is.
A month ago, when Mr. Bush released his own tax returns, he said: “One fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income.”
Mr. Bush said his average federal tax rate was 36 percent, and contrasted that with what he said was the Clintons’ 2014 tax rate: 30 percent.
It was unclear where Mr. Bush got the figure.
Mrs. Clinton’s tax return showed that her 2014 federal tax rate was 35.72, and, with city and state income taxes, was a combined rate of 45.8 percent.
Florida has no state income tax.

WASHINGTON – Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on Friday released a statement from her doctor declaring she is in “excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States,” along with eight years of tax returns showing the Clintons paid tens of millions of dollars in federal taxes.
The release comes on the same day the State Department released thousands of emails relating to her tenure as secretary of state.
In the tax returns, released late Friday afternoon, the documents show the Clintons have paid $43 million in federal taxes since 2007.
(TN) They also donated $15 million to charity, and paid an additional $13.6 million in state taxes.
The Clintons' effective federal tax rate for 2014 was 35.7 percent, while the effective tax rate for federal, state and local taxes was 45.8 percent.
Meanwhile, the statement on her health, from Dr. Lisa Bardack, an internist and chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Mount Kisco Medical Group in Mount Kisco, New York, said the former secretary of state has seasonal pollen allergies and listed "deep vein thrombosis," an elbow fracture and her 2012 concussion in her recent medical history.
Following the concussion, a subsequent blood clot developed in her brain.
As a result, Clinton experienced double vision and wore glasses with a Fresnel prism for two months.
During Clinton’s follow-up evaluations, she was found to have a “transverse sinus venous thrombosis” and started “anticoagulation therapy” to dissolve the clot.
In 2013, she tested “negative” for all clotting disorders, though continues a daily anticoagulation as a precaution, Bardack said.
Clinton’s current medications also include Armour Thyroid, which is used to treat underactive thyroids, antihistamines and Vitamin B12.
She doesn’t smoke, drinks occasionally and eats a diet rich in protein.
She also exercises regularly, practices yoga, swims, walks and weight trains, her doctor said.
At her most recent physical on March 21, her blood pressure was 100/65 and her heart rate was 72.
Her cholesterol came back at 195, with an LDL of 118, HDL of 64 and triglycerides of 69.
“(Clinton’s) cancer screening evaluations are all negative,” Bardack added.. “She is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States.”
Clinton’s camp is touting the fact she is the first 2016 candidate to release any kind of health information, though she only officially released a one-and-a-half-page letter from her doctor.
Both these releases come as the State Department releases thousands of pages of emails from her time running the department.
It was the third major release of Clinton’s email records.
The State Department has made available several hundred pages of documents in prior releases related to the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and other issues.
