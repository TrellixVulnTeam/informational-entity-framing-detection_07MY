40hpo51	[]	a	Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.	[]
40fox43	[]	a	"But we're not getting leadership,"" he said."	[]
40hpo60	[]	a	The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan’s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.	[]
40nyt9	[(0, 118)]	a	Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare.	[(0, 118)]
40hpo38	[]	a	But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.	[]
40hpo4	[]	a	But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week.	[]
40nyt2	[]	a	And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleague’s 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle.	[]
40hpo3	[]	a	Two instant surveys of Americans watching the debate -- one by CBS, one by CNN -- showed mixed results.	[]
40hpo59	[]	a	He acknowledged that Romney’s Medicare plan would not cost seniors an extra $6,400 a year, despite the claim in a recently launched Obama campaign ad.	[]
40fox7	[]	a	"Notably, he hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly videotaped comment in which he said he doesn't have to worry about the ""47 percent"" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes."	[]
40nyt13	[]	a	This time he let loose.	[]
40hpo7	[(0, 181)]	a	Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.	[(0, 181)]
40nyt0	[]	a	Joe Biden knew Lloyd Bentsen.	[]
40fox29	[]	a	"Biden also criticized Romney for making a ""political statement""on the night of the attack, a reference to Romney's criticism of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo's early response to protests there."	[]
40fox22	[]	a	"""This is becoming more troubling by the day."	[]
40hpo5	[]	a	Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive.	[]
40hpo21	[]	a	"""These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden."	[]
40nyt22	[]	a	Mr. Biden was not quite as amused.	[]
40fox38	[]	a	The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail.	[]
40nyt6	[]	a	Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama’s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as “my friend” but dismissing his arguments as “malarkey.”	[]
40fox18	[]	a	Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody.	[]

40fox46	[]	a	"Obama has acknowledged he had a ""bad night"" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward."	[]
40fox34	[]	a	"""Mr. vice president, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other,"" Ryan said."	[]
40nyt25	[]	a	She seemed determined to be less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the Obama-Romney debate.	[]
40hpo24	[]	a	The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas.	[]
40fox14	[]	a	Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen.	[]
40fox19	[]	a	Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack.	[]
40hpo14	[]	a	"The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed ""passion"" and that he showed ""a great concern for the middle class."""	[]
40nyt18	[]	a	“I love that. I love that,” Mr. Biden said.	[]
40hpo22	[(113, 224)]	a	Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years.	[(113, 224)]
40hpo36	[]	a	Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Biden’s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining.	[]
40hpo44	[]	a	"And that's what happened tonight: they lost the debate."""	[]
40hpo52	[(0, 62)]	a	Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts.	[(0, 62)]

40hpo25	[]	a	But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard.	[]
40fox16	[]	a	The tightening was reflected in the candidates' attitude onstage Thursday, each loath to give the other too many seconds of speech-time without a challenge.	[]
40fox24	[]	a	"Now they're trying to blame the Romney/Ryan ticket for making this an issue,"" he said."	[]
40nyt23	[]	a	Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his predecessor’s mistakes.	[]
40hpo6	[(50, 90)]	a	"""I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,"" the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida."	[(50, 90)]
40nyt5	[]	a	The vice presidential debate on Tuesday was supposed to be a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president’s dismal performance at his debate with the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, last week.	[]
40hpo29	[]	a	At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought.	[]
40fox35	[]	a	"On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto ""voucher"" system."	[]
40fox40	[]	a	"On abortion, he cautioned that the next president will get to choose one or two justices on the Supreme Court -- ""that's how close Roe v. Wade is."""	[]
40fox6	[(0, 77)]	a	Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not.	[(0, 77)]
40hpo39	[]	a	“I don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,” Gillespie said.	[]
40nyt15	[(0, 80)]	a	His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the camera.	[(0, 80)]
40hpo48	[]	a	One of Ryan’s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments.	[]
40hpo31	[]	a	Instead, he got the aggressive label.	[]
40hpo47	[]	a	"He raised the issue of Romney’s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could “never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."""	[]
40fox17	[]	a	The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central.	[]
40hpo53	[(0, 67)]	a	But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides.	[(0, 67)]
40fox39	[]	a	On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it.	[]
40fox5	[(0, 63)]	a	But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged.	[(0, 63)]
40fox4	[(0, 57)]	a	He chuckled and smirked through many of Ryan's responses.	[(0, 57)]
40fox42	[]	a	"""That's what we get in this administration -- speeches."	[]
40hpo41	[]	a	The Obama campaign, of course, relished in Republicans’ focus on Biden’s behavior instead of the substance of his remarks.	[]
40fox9	[]	a	"Ryan shot back, in reference to Biden's tendency to make gaffes: ""As the vice president very well knows ... sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way."""	[]
40hpo35	[(0, 36)]	a	Biden: smirking, mocking, immature.”	[(0, 36)]
40nyt26	[]	a	Mr. Ryan made a point of praising Mr. Romney, even trying to soften his image by recounting a time when Mr. Romney gave money and attention to a couple whose children were badly injured in a car accident.	[]
40fox49	[]	a	The next one will be a town hall format focusing on a range of issues, and the last one will focus exclusively on foreign policy.	[]
40hpo23	[]	a	Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election.	[]
40hpo40	[(99, 179)]	a	“There seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,” Gillespie said.	[(99, 179)]
40fox10	[]	a	"""But I always say what I mean,"" Biden responded."	[]
40fox25	[]	a	Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected.	[]
40fox27	[(0, 44)]	a	"... Not a single thing he said is accurate."""	[(0, 44)]
40hpo33	[]	a	Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Miller called Biden “unhinged.”	[]
40hpo42	[]	a	"""Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics,"" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina."	[]
40hpo49	[]	a	Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring.	[]
40nyt8	[]	a	It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night.	[]
40nyt19	[]	a	“This was such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying — writes the Department of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need this stimulus — it will create growth and jobs.”	[]
40fox20	[]	a	"""What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,"" Ryan said."	[]
40fox48	[]	a	The final presidential debates will be held Oct. 16 and Oct. 22.	[]
40fox8	[]	a	"""These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,"" Biden said, adding he's ""had it up to here"" with those kinds of comments."	[]
40nyt12	[]	a	He had to be contained and courteous when he debated Sarah Palin four years ago, lest he look like a bully.	[]
40fox11	[]	a	"Ryan accused Obama of ""projecting weakness"" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya."	[]
40fox21	[]	a	With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack.	[]
40fox44	[]	a	In a matter of days, Romney has picked up steam in both battleground and national polls.	[]
40hpo61	[]	a	Biden, aware of this, told voters they should be suspicious somebody “who would actually put in motion a plan that … added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?”	[]
40hpo58	[]	a	Biden’s argument on Medicare was aimed at voters’ guts, much more so than minds.	[]
40nyt27	[]	a	It wasn’t the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash.	[]
40hpo12	[]	a	"I hope he is [reassured],"" Axelrod said, adding that he had ""high regard for [Sullivan] by the way."""	[]
40hpo46	[]	a	Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago.	[]
40fox32	[]	a	After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge.	[]
40fox2	[(0, 57)]	a	But it was the vice president who set the aggressive tone, blatantly striving to hit the reset after President Obama was panned for his lackluster performance at last week's opening debate.	[(0, 57)]
40hpo2	[]	a	What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out.	[]
40hpo28	[(1, 39)]	a	"""Not a single thing he said is accurate,"" Biden said."	[(1, 39)]
40hpo17	[]	a	“I think the way the vice president handled himself was condescending,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).	[]
40fox23	[]	a	They first blamed the YouTube video.	[]
40fox41	[]	a	"Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a ""debt crisis is coming"" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit."	[]
40nyt1	[]	a	Lloyd Bentsen was a friend of Joe Biden’s.	[]
40fox0	[]	a	In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions.	[]
40nyt20	[]	a	When Mr. Biden went after Mr. Romney’s infamous remark at a private fund-raiser about the “47 percent,” Mr. Ryan reminded the vice president of his own propensity for gaffes.	[]
40hpo45	[]	a	Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else.	[]
40fox31	[]	a	The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate.	[]
40hpo43	[]	a	"""You're going to do that when you've lost a debate."	[]
40hpo30	[(36, 94), (96, 135)]	a	If it were anyone other than Biden, who is treated by the press as a lovable, half-crazy uncle, he would have been labeled insufferable.	[(36, 94), (96, 135)]
40nyt11	[(78, 111)]	a	For Mr. Biden especially, the night was his chance to relive past debates and unleash his inner barroom brawler.	[(78, 111)]
40hpo27	[(181, 207)]	a	"After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: ""That's a bunch of malarkey."""	[(181, 207)]
40hpo9	[(0, 173)]	a	It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -– and buck up -– worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate.	[(0, 173)]
40nyt3	[]	a	Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the economy.	[]
40hpo50	[]	a	And he then added: “With respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.”	[]
40fox45	[]	a	The latest Fox News national poll of likely voters showed Romney edging Obama, 46 percent to 45 percent.	[]
40hpo10	[]	a	No one represented that Democratic angst more than blogger Andrew Sullivan, a supporter of the president.	[]
40fox1	[]	a	The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes.	[]
40hpo1	[]	a	The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.	[]
40hpo26	[]	a	It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president.	[]
40nyt21	[]	a	“I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don’t come out of your mouth the right way,” he said with a gotcha smile.	[]
40hpo0	[(84, 103)]	a	DANVILLE, Ky. –- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more.	[(84, 103)]
40nyt24	[]	a	Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the moderator, and she made a point of speaking forcefully, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly.	[]
40nyt7	[(0, 190)]	a	He laughed at Mr. Ryan’s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent.	[(0, 190)]
40nyt14	[(81, 173)]	a	And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts.	[(81, 173)]
40hpo20	[]	a	Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.	[]
40fox36	[]	a	"""Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare,"" he said."	[]
40hpo18	[]	a	“He was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people.	[]
40hpo55	[]	a	Show me something. Show me a policy,” Biden said.	[]
40fox15	[]	a	There are two more presidential debates on the calendar, and the polls have started to swing in Romney's favor.	[]
40nyt16	[]	a	Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his own district.	[]
40hpo32	[]	a	Republicans thought it was much more than that.	[]
40nyt10	[]	a	“I know you’re under duress,” he told the vice president, prompting another belly laugh.	[]
40nyt28	[]	a	A version of this article appears in print on October 12, 2012, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Night of Withering Ripostes, Mostly Delivered by Biden.	[]
40fox13	[]	a	"""This is not what a real recovery looks like,"" Ryan said."	[]
40hpo34	[(41, 69)]	a	Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: “Ryan: serious, sober, steady.	[(41, 69)]
40hpo8	[]	a	“He had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate.	[]
40nyt17	[]	a	“On two occasions, we — we — we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants,” Mr. Ryan said stiffly.	[]
40fox33	[]	a	Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.	[]
40hpo57	[]	a	Biden didn’t worry so much about numbers.	[]
40hpo54	[]	a	“Stop talking about how you care about people.	[]
40hpo16	[]	a	By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans.	[]
40hpo56	[]	a	Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.	[]
40fox37	[]	a	"Ryan shot back: ""They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare."""	[]
40hpo15	[]	a	Passion was the thing Obama lacked last week, and Romney surprised the president and Democrats by talking constantly about how his policies would help the middle class.	[]
40fox30	[]	a	"On the question of why the administration initially claimed the attack was the result of a protest, Biden explained ""the intelligence community told us that."""	[]
40fox47	[]	a	"After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a ""happy warrior"" for the middle class."	[]
40hpo37	[]	a	“Most people probably found the vice president’s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,” said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.	[]
40fox3	[]	a	If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.	[]
40fox28	[]	a	"He added: ""This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about."""	[]
3hpo2	[]	a	"""If they [Democrats] don't pass this bill in the next couple weeks it will materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,"" he told a gathering of reporters at an off camera briefing."	[]

3fox22	[]	a	And they're trying to get us to jam it through again.	[]
3nyt15	[]	a	John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a close ally of Mr. Obama, issued a statement calling the tax deal “a steep price” but saying the president was “right to choose helping working Americans over a December conflagration.” 	[]
3fox9	[]	a	Vice President Biden traveled to the Capitol Wednesday for a private meeting with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy.	[]
3fox14	[]	a	Liberals are going as far as trying to prevent outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing the tax cut compromise to the floor.	[]
3nyt7	[]	a	In a joint appearance at the White House with Mr. Komorowski, Mr. Obama said that “economists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth” after the tax deal was announced on Monday night.	[]
3hpo24	[]	a	We know that on January 1 people's taxes will go up, we know that at the end of this month 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance.	[]
3hpo18	[]	a	Asked, for instance, if the White House would be willing to revise the informal compromise to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said any changes would be fine, so long as they didn't result in decreased support.	[]
3fox4	[]	a	Positive reviews coming in from economists, Summers said, show the deal is the right thing to do.	[]
3fox12	[(0, 112)]	a	In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits for people who have been unemployed for long stretches.	[(0, 112)]
3nyt5	[]	a	The American people are watching, and they’re expecting action on our parts,” Mr. Obama said.	[]
3nyt26	[]	a	In the House, Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday morning that the sense of disappointment with the president remained strong.	[]
3fox25	[]	a	"Speaking to reporters at a joint appearance with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, Obama said economists predict higher job growth in 2011 and 2012 if Congress passes the agreement and urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and ""get this done."""	[]
3nyt0	[]	a	Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, just told a group of reporters that failure to pass a package like the tax deal announced by President Obama this week “would significantly increase the risk” of a double-dip recession.	[]
3hpo1	[(0, 64)]	a	It wasn't quite the metaphorical flare of mushroom cloud imagery, but outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a fairly dire assessment of the stakes in the tax cut debate.	[(0, 64)]
3hpo27	[]	a	"And what we know for sure is that without any of it we are facing a really difficult situation."""	[]
3fox3	[]	a	"Summers said that he doesn't think that Congress would take a step that ""materially increases the risk that this economy will stall out."""	[]
3hpo6	[]	a	Summers himself, downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts back in September -- though he was speaking, then, about the rates for the rich and the tax cut deal, at that point in time, did not include money for a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance or other tax incentives to help lower income workers.	[]
3nyt27	[]	a	“I don’t think it was preordained that if we had a deadlock, they would have won it,” said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, in an interview on MSNBC.	[]

3fox17	[]	a	"""There does not seem to be a majority of the Democrats who support the deal negotiated by Vice President Biden,"" he told Fox News."	[]
