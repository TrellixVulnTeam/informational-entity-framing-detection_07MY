79nyt0	[]	a	WASHINGTON — The lawmakers trotted from their dugouts at Nationals Park, together in a near-summer air that never quite felt swampy, united in a certainty that the game must go on, just not exactly as it had before.	[]

79hpo9	[]	a	The Trumps also met with Crystal Griner, one of the two U.S. Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, and her wife.	[]
79hpo35	[]	a	“There’s no place I could go,” he said.	[]
79nyt45	[]	a	He received a standing ovation when he was introduced as a team member, with Democrats waving their caps at his image on the screen beyond the outfield fence.	[]
79fox22	[]	a	“We start surrounding these folks with layers of guards—it will really cripple the ability to be a free society,” he said on “Outnumbered.”	[]
79hpo37	[]	a	The event pits Republicans against Democrats and raises funds for area nonprofits, including the Washington Literacy Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation.	[]
79nyt10	[]	a	But by nightfall, the decision was clear.	[]
79hpo24	[]	a	The FBI said it was processing a cell phone, a computer and a camera recovered from Hodgkinson’s van, which was in the parking lot of a YMCA adjacent to the park.	[]
79fox12	[]	a	This year's town halls to date have been particularly rowdy and tense, prompting lawmaker concerns long before Wednesday's attack.	[]
79fox1	[]	a	"Thursday night, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center issued a statement saying Scalise ""underwent a second surgery related to his internal injuries and a broken bone in his leg."	[]
79hpo18	[]	a	U.S. Capitol Police officers assigned to Scalise engaged Hodgkinson in gunfire, and Alexandria Police responded soon after.	[]
79nyt16	[]	a	At work on Thursday, those pangs visited lawmakers like a too-familiar houseguest — stalking them down the Capitol’s corridors, past the Senate chamber where a ferocious health care debate had already resumed, along the hall where some had stood one day earlier as survivors, still in dusted cleats and uniforms, unharmed but unsettled.	[]
79fox0	[]	a	Lawmakers at the scene of Wednesday’s baseball practice shooting described themselves as “sitting ducks” and said the violence would have been a “massacre” if not for Majority Whip Steve Scalise's detail -- spurring new questions over whether congressional security practices should be overhauled.	[]
79hpo32	[]	a	“It would’ve been a massacre without them,” he said.	[]
79fox20	[]	a	Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich lauded the current system where lawmakers interact with the people on a regular basis in settings like grocery stores.	[]
79fox7	[]	a	Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., acknowledged the incident has sparked new security questions for members without assigned police protection at events outside Capitol Hill.	[]
79fox17	[]	a	A detail for every lawmaker is likely not possible -- and security already is provided for major events and lawmakers facing a specific threat.	[]
79nyt27	[(0, 102)]	a	And Ms. Pelosi could not resist suggesting that Republicans were the initiators of the present rancor.	[(0, 102)]
79hpo23	[]	a	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ran traces on the weapons and found no evidence to suggest Hodgkinson purchased the firearms illegally, according to an FBI statement released Thursday.	[]
79nyt41	[]	a	David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was wounded while helping to stop the attack, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.	[]
79hpo56	[]	a	“I imagined it would be something fun to watch, you know, because evidently it’s partisan politics are put aside, let’s have a softball game, let’s have some fun,” he said.	[]
79hpo38	[]	a	This year’s game is scheduled for Thursday night.	[]
79nyt24	[(0, 107)]	a	In a Thursday morning tweet, Mr. Trump railed against the “WITCH HUNT” of investigations of his associates.	[(0, 107)]
79nyt23	[]	a	Even one day out from the initial anguish, much of the political ecosystem seemed unchanged.	[]
79hpo22	[]	a	The shooter’s weapons ― a 9 mm handgun and 7.62-caliber rifle ― were recovered at the scene by law enforcement officials.	[]
79nyt32	[]	a	House interns hauled signs: “Scalise Strong,” “Capitol Police MVP” and “Unvidvided” in red, white, and blue.	[]
79nyt31	[]	a	But for an optimist in the city — and there still seem to be a few — there were flourishes to appreciate.	[]
79fox5	[]	a	His detail was credited with putting down the attacker and saving lives.	[]
79nyt36	[]	a	Ms. Pelosi sat for an interview alongside Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.	[]
79nyt37	[]	a	The Senate leaders — Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer of New York — did the same.	[]
79hpo20	[]	a	The FBI is investigating Hodgkinson and his possible motives.	[]
79fox31	[]	a	But he said they need to consider “the dangers” that come with public forums.	[]
79nyt52	[]	a	Chants of “We love you, Pelosi!” rang out briefly, until the minority leader acknowledged them.	[]
79nyt3	[]	a	Beneath a mostly cloudless sky, at least by the mid-innings, fans in the stands intermingled red and blue.	[]
79hpo7	[]	a	Before the surgery, Scalise was “in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,” his office said.	[]
79nyt17	[]	a	The reaction would be different this time, some said.	[]
79nyt58	[]	a	“Tone down our own rhetoric and not ascribe the worst motives to our colleagues,” he said hopefully.	[]
79hpo43	[]	a	“They’re just grateful everyone was able to work together as a team and get out.”	[]
79hpo16	[]	a	His condition was upgraded from “critical” to “serious” on Thursday, a spokeswoman for George Washington University Hospital confirmed to HuffPost.	[]
79hpo54	[]	a	The FBI is taking over the investigation into the shooting, Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said.	[]
79fox10	[]	a	“Forty guys get together at the same time, that would be a major security event normally, but I think we got a little excited and didn’t think things through as well as we could have.”	[]
79hpo40	[]	a	A lockdown has been lifted at the YMCA Alexandria, next to the field where the shooting took place, spokeswoman Dana Rucker told HuffPost.	[]
79hpo29	[]	a	Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told reporters that he used his belt as a tourniquet to stop a staffer’s bleeding.	[]
79nyt38	[(51, 97)]	a	“We don’t dislike each other,” Mr. McConnell said, deploying a rare complimentary double negative.	[(51, 97)]
79nyt30	[]	a	It’ll be for another day.”	[]
79nyt51	[]	a	A cutout of the head of Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, was held high.	[]
79hpo26	[]	a	“Let me be as clear as I can be,” Sanders said in a statement.	[]

79fox32	[]	a	“You have to consider that there is a lot of information for the public—obviously members want to give as much information as they can—a lot of calendars are broadcast, social media, information is readily available,” Norton said.	[]
79hpo28	[]	a	Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who was also at the practice, told MSNBC that Scalise crawled through the dirt, bleeding, to get away from the shooter.	[]

79nyt28	[]	a	“Somewhere in the ’90s, Republicans decided on a politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons,” she told reporters earlier on Thursday.	[]

79nyt15	[]	a	All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol.	[]
25nyt3	[]	a	But their efforts, which come after both chambers overwhelmingly passed the bill, are almost certain to be futile, and members of both parties have vowed to override the bill.	[]
25hpo22	[]	a	But those arguments didn’t sway lawmakers, who say the White House’s case is overblown.	[]
25nyt4	[]	a	Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who plans to support the override effort, tried on Tuesday to play down any split between Democrats and Mr. Obama.	[]
25hpo2	[]	a	It’s also the result of some unusual alliances: Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who is on track to become the next Democratic leader, led the effort against the president alongside Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), a conservative member of Republican leadership.	[]
25fox25	[]	a	The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks.	[]
25hpo6	[]	a	Party leaders got well above that level.	[]
25hpo24	[]	a	“The bill is near and dear to my heart as a New Yorker because it would allow the victims of 9/11 to pursue some small measure of justice,” Schumer said Wednesday.	[]
25fox8	[]	a	If they had nothing to do with 9/11, they have nothing to fear,” Schumer said.	[]
25hpo7	[]	a	The final tally was 97-1.	[]
25hpo12	[]	a	The House voted later on Wednesday to override the veto, causing the bill to become law.	[]
25hpo3	[]	a	“This is pretty much close to a miraculous occurrence,” Cornyn said before the vote.	[]
25nyt0	[]	a	As part of its final bit of business before the election, Congress is set to vote to override President Obama’s veto of a bill allowing families of those killed in the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the terrorist plot.	[]
25nyt1	[]	a	The override, the first Mr. Obama has faced in his presidency, is expected to begin in the Senate on Wednesday, followed by the House on Thursday.	[]
25hpo20	[]	a	The European Union and former top executive branch officials have urged Obama to stop it, in the name of protecting sovereign immunity.	[]
25nyt8	[]	a	The bill, which Saudi Arabia has fiercely opposed and has hired a phalanx of lobbyists to combat, addresses a 1976 law that gives other countries broad immunity from American lawsuits, amending it to allow for nations to be sued in federal courts if they are found to have played any role in terrorist attacks that killed Americans on home soil.	[]
25fox20	[]	a	The bill cleared the House earlier this month, also by voice vote.	[]
25fox30	[]	a	"But the bill's proponents have disputed Obama's rationale as ""unconvincing and unsupportable,"" saying the measure is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil."	[]

25fox5	[]	a	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speaking on the Senate floor moments before Wednesday's vote in that chamber, pushed back hard on Saudi government objections to the legislation.	[]
25fox14	[]	a	"In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Reid, Obama warned the bill could cause chaos in U.S. foreign affairs, as other countries would use the measure to justify the creation of ways to target ""U.S. policies and activities that they oppose."""	[]
25fox4	[(1, 72)]	a	"""This bill is about respecting the voices and rights of American victims,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said."	[(1, 72)]
25hpo1	[]	a	It’s the first time a chamber of Congress has had the votes to overrule Obama on a veto.	[]
25hpo27	[]	a	Obama vetoed the bill last week and issued a lengthy statement with it.	[]
25hpo4	[]	a	“All of us have come together and agreed this is the appropriate and right thing to do.”	[]
25fox29	[]	a	Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory litigation in foreign courts that could put U.S. troops in legal jeopardy.	[]
25hpo13	[]	a	The bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, prevents Saudi Arabia and other countries with alleged ties to terrorist groups from invoking their legal immunity in U.S. courts.	[]
25fox22	[]	a	But the legislation could lead to the public disclosure of American secrets and even undercut counterterrorism efforts by sowing mistrust among U.S. partners and allies, according to Carter.	[]
