23nyt0	[]	a	WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, the committee’s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn’s troubles with Congress.	[]

23hpo12	[]	a	He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associates’ ties to Russia.	[]
23fox4	[]	a	The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections.	[]

23fox5	[]	a	Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions.	[]
23hpo17	[]	a	“If the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didn’t agree with, then you’re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,” Schiff said.	[]
23hpo0	[]	a	WASHINGTON ― The House intelligence committee is preparing to issue subpoenas against Michael Flynn after the former national security adviser denied a request to voluntarily turn over documents related to the committee’s Russia probe.	[]
23hpo10	[]	a	And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBI’s Russia investigation.	[]
23hpo5	[]	a	The House committee’s subpoenas “will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.	[]
23nyt19	[]	a	Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.	[]
23fox6	[]	a	Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.	[]
23hpo3	[]	a	Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn’s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia’s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump’s associates.	[]
23hpo4	[]	a	The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn’s businesses.	[]
23nyt21	[]	a	Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee, has dismissed that option.	[]
23hpo14	[]	a	Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.	[]
23hpo7	[]	a	Schiff said he is “skeptical” that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.	[]
23nyt16	[]	a	On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016.	[]
23fox8	[]	a	Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge.	[]
23hpo16	[]	a	Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office.	[]
23hpo15	[]	a	“There’s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there’s a very practical standard that has to be met,” Schiff said.	[]
23nyt12	[(93, 197)]	a	Mr. Flynn’s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation.	[(93, 197)]
23hpo1	[]	a	Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use “whatever compulsory process we need” to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas.	[]
23nyt20	[]	a	As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution.	[]
23nyt9	[]	a	The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynn’s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections.	[]
23hpo8	[]	a	The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump’s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.	[]
23nyt8	[]	a	Mr. Conaway has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of the investigation while it is continuing.	[]
23hpo11	[]	a	“That could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,” Schiff said of Trump’s reported request to Coats and Rogers.	[]
23nyt14	[]	a	He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence.	[]
23nyt17	[]	a	Among the payments he did not disclose was a $45,000 fee from a Russian state-backed news organization for a speech he gave in Moscow two months before.	[]
23nyt10	[]	a	On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment’s protections against self-incrimination.	[]
23nyt5	[]	a	It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynn’s testimony, or both.	[]
23nyt1	[]	a	The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel’s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election.	[]
23fox0	[]	a	The leaders of the Senate intelligence committee said Tuesday they had subpoenaed two of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's businesses as part of the ongoing probe into Russian activity during last year's presidential campaign.	[]
23fox1	[]	a	Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the committee, identified the businesses as Flynn Intel Group LLC and Flynn Intel Group Inc., both based in Alexandria, Va.	[]
23hpo13	[]	a	“If all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, that’s something that we have to find out about and it’s something we have to stop,” he said.	[]
23nyt2	[]	a	“Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.	[]
23fox3	[]	a	"""A business does not have the right to take the fifth,"" Warner told reporters."	[]
23nyt6	[]	a	The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee.	[]
23nyt3	[]	a	“And I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.”	[]
23fox2	[]	a	The committee's action comes a day after Flynn’s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committee’s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation.	[]
23nyt4	[]	a	Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess.	[]
23hpo9	[]	a	Trump implied earlier this month that he had “tapes” of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey.	[]
23fox7	[]	a	Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynn’s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents.	[]

36nyt6	[]	a	The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clinton’s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private.	[]
36hpo9	[]	a	“What the Committee cannot do is conclude its work without assurances the Committee has all relevant information necessary for us to discharge the duties required of us.”	[]
36nyt0	[]	a	WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.	[]
36nyt15	[]	a	“To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.”	[]
36nyt21	[(108, 129)]	a	On Monday, Mr. Priebus said in an appearance on Fox News that Mrs. Clinton’s decision to delete her emails “is criminal in nature.”	[(108, 129)]
36hpo8	[]	a	“We share the Secretary’s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary’s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,” Gowdy said.	[]
36nyt2	[]	a	He added that Mrs. Clinton’s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted “only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.”	[]
36hpo13	[]	a	Clinton is not the only government official to use a private email for work.	[]
36fox0	[]	a	"The congressional committee probing the Benghazi attacks has formally requested that Hillary Clinton appear for an interview on her use of a personal email and server for official business while secretary of state, after learning the server had been wiped ""clean."""	[]
36nyt9	[]	a	At a news conference at the United Nations a little more than a week after The Times’s report, Mrs. Clinton first said she “chose not to keep” her private personal emails.	[]
36nyt27	[(1, 72)]	a	“And I’m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.”	[(1, 72)]
36nyt3	[]	a	The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department’s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.	[]
36fox3	[]	a	Gowdy said Friday that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, has yet to adequately respond to the subpoena request for the server.	[]
36fox10	[]	a	"""I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,” he said on Fox News' ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."""	[]
36nyt17	[]	a	“Rather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,” he said.	[]
36nyt1	[]	a	Mrs. Clinton’s “email arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer Tuesday morning.	[]
36hpo1	[]	a	In a letter to the Clinton’s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to “Libya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.”	[]
36nyt18	[]	a	Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya — and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clinton’s email practices — from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president.	[]
36nyt14	[]	a	“It is by their choice that hasn’t happened,” said the spokesman, Nick Merrill.	[]
36fox7	[]	a	The South Carolina Republican set a deadline of May 1 for the interview and restated the committee is interested only in the deleted emails relating to Clinton’s response as secretary of state to the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed.	[]
36fox6	[]	a	Earlier this month, Clinton acknowledged that she sent or received roughly 60,000 related emails, turning over roughly half to the State Department and deleting about the same number of “personal” ones.	[]
36nyt8	[(0, 235)]	a	Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.	[(0, 235)]
36hpo5	[]	a	The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state.	[]
36hpo4	[]	a	An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate’s privacy and security for sensitive information.	[]
36nyt25	[]	a	In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Priebus had overstepped his expertise.	[]
36nyt11	[]	a	Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that “a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.”	[]
36nyt29	[]	a	“We should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.”	[]
36hpo2	[]	a	“Toward that end and because of the Secretary’s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy stated in the letter.	[]
36fox1	[]	a	Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer.	[]
36hpo6	[]	a	Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean.	[]
36fox11	[]	a	He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.	[]
36fox4	[(30, 111)]	a	He said the committee learned she had “unilaterally decided” to wipe it clean and permanently delete all emails.	[(30, 111)]
36nyt26	[(1, 67)]	a	“As far as I know, he’s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,” Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus.	[(1, 67)]
36nyt28	[]	a	“We don’t know enough facts, so why speculate?” Mr. Gowdy added.	[]
36nyt7	[]	a	Then, he said, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months.	[]
36hpo11	[(78, 183)]	a	Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she “thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.”	[(78, 183)]
36nyt19	[]	a	But the time frame in which he is asking Mrs. Clinton to submit to questioning — at any time before May 1 — coincides with the period in which she is widely expected to make her candidacy official.	[]
36fox9	[]	a	"Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have ""separate conversations"" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server."	[]
36fox8	[]	a	“The committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,” Gowdy also wrote in the letter.	[]
36nyt12	[]	a	But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting.	[]
36nyt16	[]	a	The committee’s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview.	[]
36hpo3	[]	a	Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.	[]
36nyt4	[]	a	But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.	[]
36nyt24	[]	a	“There are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.”	[]
36fox5	[]	a	“This committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy wrote to Clinton attorney David Kendall on Tuesday.	[]
36hpo7	[]	a	Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.	[]
36nyt10	[]	a	But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “will remain private.”	[]
36hpo12	[(0, 86)]	a	She admitted that “looking back,” it would have been better to carry the second phone.	[(0, 86)]
