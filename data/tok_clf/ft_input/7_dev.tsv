26nyt28	[]	a	Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient.	[]
26hpo26	[]	a	In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.	[]

26nyt40	[]	a	The back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.	[]
26fox37	[]	a	"On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' “Tucker Carlson Tonight” that the terms of the negotiations were clear: ""Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal."""	[]

26fox8	[]	a	"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them ""he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”"	[]
26fox18	[(130, 199)]	a	The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump’s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives. 	[(130, 199)]

26nyt35	[]	a	Wednesday’s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion.

26hpo19	[(0, 44)]	a	Trump’s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.	[(0, 44)]
26hpo29	[]	a	More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.	[]
26fox28	[]	a	Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall.	[]
26hpo24	[]	a	During the campaign, he promised a “great, great” wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath.	[]
26nyt20	[]	a	Mr. Trump’s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22.	[]
26nyt42	[(38, 71)]	a	“It was incredibly disheartening that they don’t want to know the facts when making policy.”	[(38, 71)]
26fox34	[]	a	"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on ""Fox & Friends"" earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment."	[]
26fox16	[]	a	"Trump later said the group would ""determine what we're going to do about the border."" "	[]
26nyt39	[]	a	Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.	[]
