23nyt1	0	a	The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel’s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election.	0
23nyt15	0	a	Mr. Flynn’s legal troubles have only mounted in recent days.	0
23fox7	0	a	Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynn’s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents.	0
23fox8	0	a	Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge.	0
23hpo1	0	a	Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use “whatever compulsory process we need” to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas.	0
23nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, the committee’s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn’s troubles with Congress.	0
23nyt10	0	a	On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment’s protections against self-incrimination.	0
23hpo15	0	a	“There’s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there’s a very practical standard that has to be met,” Schiff said.	0
23nyt16	0	a	On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016.	0
23hpo11	0	a	“That could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,” Schiff said of Trump’s reported request to Coats and Rogers.	0
23fox3	0	a	"""A business does not have the right to take the fifth,"" Warner told reporters."	0
23hpo5	0	a	The House committee’s subpoenas “will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.	0
23nyt20	0	a	As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution.	0
23hpo9	0	a	Trump implied earlier this month that he had “tapes” of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey.	0
23hpo17	0	a	“If the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didn’t agree with, then you’re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,” Schiff said.	0
23hpo10	0	a	And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBI’s Russia investigation.	0
23nyt4	0	a	Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess.	0
23hpo2	0	a	He added that the committee could issue additional subpoenas if other witnesses fail to cooperate, but did not name additional individuals.	0
23nyt14	0	a	He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence.	0
23fox5	0	a	Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions.	0
23hpo13	0	a	“If all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, that’s something that we have to find out about and it’s something we have to stop,” he said.	0
23nyt18	0	a	During that trip, he was photographed at a gala sitting next to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.	0
23nyt3	0	a	“And I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.”	0
23nyt5	0	a	It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynn’s testimony, or both.	0
23hpo3	0	a	Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn’s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia’s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump’s associates.	0
23hpo8	0	a	The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump’s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.	0
23fox9	0	a	"""Everything is on the table,"" Burr said."	0
23hpo6	0	a	“We need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses … the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,” he added.	0
23hpo16	0	a	Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office.	0
23nyt21	0	a	Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee, has dismissed that option.	0
23hpo14	0	a	Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.	0
23hpo4	0	a	The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn’s businesses.	0
23nyt12	1	a	Mr. Flynn’s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation.	1
23nyt6	0	a	The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee.	0
23nyt9	0	a	The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynn’s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections.	0
23nyt2	0	a	“Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.	0
23nyt13	0	a	The Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign.	0
23hpo12	0	a	He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associates’ ties to Russia.	0
23nyt7	0	a	A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	0
23fox4	0	a	The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections.	0
23nyt19	0	a	Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.	0
23fox2	0	a	The committee's action comes a day after Flynn’s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committee’s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation.	0
23nyt11	0	a	He also declined the Senate committee’s invitation for an interview.	0
23hpo7	0	a	Schiff said he is “skeptical” that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.	0
23fox6	0	a	Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.	0
36fox3	0	a	Gowdy said Friday that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, has yet to adequately respond to the subpoena request for the server.	0
36nyt29	0	a	“We should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.”	0
36nyt18	0	a	Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya — and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clinton’s email practices — from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president.	0
36nyt2	0	a	He added that Mrs. Clinton’s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted “only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.”	0
36fox11	0	a	He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.	0
36nyt19	0	a	But the time frame in which he is asking Mrs. Clinton to submit to questioning — at any time before May 1 — coincides with the period in which she is widely expected to make her candidacy official.	0
36nyt15	0	a	“To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.”	0
36nyt1	0	a	Mrs. Clinton’s “email arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer Tuesday morning.	0
36nyt25	0	a	In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Priebus had overstepped his expertise.	0
36fox10	0	a	"""I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,” he said on Fox News' ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."""	0
36hpo4	0	a	An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate’s privacy and security for sensitive information.	0
36hpo10	1	a	Gowdy went on to call Clinton’s email situation “highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” and said it “exacerbates” lawmakers’ needs to “understand what the Secretary did.”	1
36hpo11	1	a	Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she “thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.”	1
36nyt24	0	a	“There are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.”	0
36nyt26	1	a	“As far as I know, he’s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,” Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus.	1
36nyt28	0	a	“We don’t know enough facts, so why speculate?” Mr. Gowdy added.	0
36nyt23	1	a	“Even Nixon didn’t destroy the tapes,” Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation.	1
36nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.	0
36fox4	1	a	He said the committee learned she had “unilaterally decided” to wipe it clean and permanently delete all emails.	1
36nyt16	0	a	The committee’s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview.	0
36fox0	0	a	"The congressional committee probing the Benghazi attacks has formally requested that Hillary Clinton appear for an interview on her use of a personal email and server for official business while secretary of state, after learning the server had been wiped ""clean."""	0
36nyt4	0	a	But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.	0
36hpo2	0	a	“Toward that end and because of the Secretary’s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy stated in the letter.	0
36fox6	0	a	Earlier this month, Clinton acknowledged that she sent or received roughly 60,000 related emails, turning over roughly half to the State Department and deleting about the same number of “personal” ones.	0
36nyt11	0	a	Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that “a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.”	0
36nyt6	0	a	The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clinton’s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private.	0
36hpo13	0	a	Clinton is not the only government official to use a private email for work.	0
36fox9	0	a	"Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have ""separate conversations"" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server."	0
36nyt20	0	a	Some Republicans on Capitol Hill — including Mr. Gowdy — are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue.	0
36nyt13	0	a	In a written statement, a spokesman for her said she had told the committee months ago that she was prepared to testify at a public hearing.	0
36hpo7	0	a	Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.	0
36fox8	0	a	“The committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,” Gowdy also wrote in the letter.	0
36fox2	0	a	"Gowdy asked that Clinton agree to a ""transcribed"" interview -- and repeated a March 16 request for her to surrender her server so it can be examined by the State Department’s inspector general."	0
36hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi sent a formal interview request to Hillary Clinton’s lawyer on Tuesday regarding emails she exchanged during her time as secretary of state.	0
36nyt3	0	a	The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department’s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.	0
36fox12	0	a	Clinton has not yet announced a presidential bid.	0
36hpo12	1	a	She admitted that “looking back,” it would have been better to carry the second phone.	1
36nyt21	1	a	On Monday, Mr. Priebus said in an appearance on Fox News that Mrs. Clinton’s decision to delete her emails “is criminal in nature.”	1
36nyt27	1	a	“And I’m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.”	1
36hpo8	0	a	“We share the Secretary’s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary’s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,” Gowdy said.	0
36nyt17	0	a	“Rather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,” he said.	0
36hpo6	0	a	Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean.	0
36hpo3	0	a	Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.	0
36nyt8	1	a	Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.	1
36fox1	0	a	Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer.	0
36nyt22	0	a	“I mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,” Mr. Priebus said on “Fox and Friends.”	0
36nyt10	0	a	But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “will remain private.”	0
36fox7	0	a	The South Carolina Republican set a deadline of May 1 for the interview and restated the committee is interested only in the deleted emails relating to Clinton’s response as secretary of state to the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed.	0
36hpo1	0	a	In a letter to the Clinton’s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to “Libya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.”	0
36nyt5	0	a	In October, the State Department asked former secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide it with any government records — like emails — they might have in their possession.	0
36hpo14	0	a	Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said he used a private email during his time in office, as did Jeb Bush when he served as governor of Florida.	0
36nyt7	0	a	Then, he said, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months.	0
36nyt12	0	a	But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting.	0
36hpo5	0	a	The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state.	0
36fox5	0	a	“This committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy wrote to Clinton attorney David Kendall on Tuesday.	0

62nyt11	0	a	Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday.	0
62fox4	0	a	"He called the disclosure of the program that allows the NSA to collect communications data from Internet companies ""reprehensible"" and said the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation's intelligence gathering activities."	0

62fox10	0	a	"Several hours earlier, a senior administration official also pushed back, saying the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that ""does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.”"	0

62nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an “internal government computer system” designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009.	0
62fox25	0	a	To be immune from lawsuits, companies like Yahoo and AOL are reportedly obliged to accept a directive from the attorney general and national intelligence director to open their service to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit, which acts as a liaison between the companies and the NSA.	0
62nyt23	0	a	“Now that the fact of bulk collection has been declassified, we believe that more information about the scale of the collection, and specifically whether it involves the records of ‘millions of Americans,’ should be declassified as well,” they said.	0
62hpo19	1	a	The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations.	1
62hpo6	0	a	The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.	0

62hpo3	1	a	"""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006."""	1
62nyt4	0	a	Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government “does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers” of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a “documented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisition” of the data.	0
62nyt12	0	a	The administration, by disclosing the briefings, sought to push back on claims by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that they were either not aware of programs to mine vast amounts of Internet data and business telephone records or were insufficiently briefed on the details.	0
62fox17	0	a	The official told Fox News that the Utah Data Center is likely a repository for this material.	0
62fox16	0	a	Metadata from the companies is used to identify suspicious individuals and the secondary search goes into content.	0

70fox5	0	a	But the address was stitched together, more broadly, by an appeal for a “new national pride” and a rediscovery of American patriotism, as he described this as a salve for the country’s divisions.	0
70nyt56	0	a	From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump’s election.	0

17nyt0	0	a	The battle for control of the Republican National Committee will take a new turn on Monday when Michael Steele announces whether he plans to step down as party chairman or will disregard the onslaught of criticism about his oversight of the committee and seek a second term.	0

17fox5	0	a	Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House, narrowed the gap in the Senate and picked up 19 state legislative bodies in the November midtem election, but pressure has been mounting all year for Steele to step down from the position.	0

17hpo6	0	a	Steele's gaffe-prone tenure at the helm of the RNC has aided the creation of a significant bloc of GOPers who are intent on seeing his departure next month.	0
17nyt13	0	a	The contenders for the position include: Reince Preibus, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party; Ann Wagner of Missouri, an ambassador to Luxembourg in the Bush administration; Maria Cino, a veteran Republican operative who has the support of former Vice President Dick Cheney; Saul Anuzis, former Republican chairman in Michigan; and Gentry Collins, who resigned last month as political director.	0

79fox0	0	a	Lawmakers at the scene of Wednesday’s baseball practice shooting described themselves as “sitting ducks” and said the violence would have been a “massacre” if not for Majority Whip Steve Scalise's detail -- spurring new questions over whether congressional security practices should be overhauled.	0
79hpo17	0	a	The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, less than 8 miles south of the White House.	0
79hpo23	0	a	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ran traces on the weapons and found no evidence to suggest Hodgkinson purchased the firearms illegally, according to an FBI statement released Thursday.	0

79hpo9	0	a	The Trumps also met with Crystal Griner, one of the two U.S. Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, and her wife.	0
79nyt48	0	a	Several elements of the evening did diverge sharply from the ballpark’s standard, professional fare — commonplace for a congressional game that has, since 1909, produced a steady torrent of middling baseball, worse trash talk and more than occasional injury.	0
79hpo22	0	a	The shooter’s weapons ― a 9 mm handgun and 7.62-caliber rifle ― were recovered at the scene by law enforcement officials.	0
79fox27	0	a	Doyle, too, suggested that could be the solution: “I think when you’re in an area with 30 or 40 members, where anyone can walk through, we need to re-think that—but I think most members would tell you they feel fine and they’re not looking for any security.”	0
79hpo5	0	a	“He underwent immediate surgery and an additional procedure to stop bleeding,” the hospital said, noting the congressman had received multiple blood transfusions and remained in critical condition late Wednesday.	0
79hpo34	0	a	He said he heard at least 30 shots and got down on the ground, but couldn’t see the shooter.	0
79fox19	0	a	“I bet most members of Congress would say they don’t want [a] security detail—I sure don’t,” Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., manager of the Democratic congressional baseball team, told reporters.	0
79hpo46	0	a	Lawmakers from both parties expressed sympathy for the victims.	0
79fox9	0	a	“We already had concerns and we have great law enforcement at home, first responders do a great job, but this makes you anticipate every event now in a new way,” Brat said on Fox News’ “America’s News HQ” on Wednesday.	0

79hpo55	0	a	Jay Roberts, 60, lives nearby and said the game was “probably one of the few moments with all this rancor and politics that they can have some normalcy.”	0
79fox20	0	a	Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich lauded the current system where lawmakers interact with the people on a regular basis in settings like grocery stores.	0
79nyt14	0	a	“I have to stay,” he said softly.	0
79nyt30	0	a	It’ll be for another day.”	0
79nyt42	0	a	(The ball was delivered to the mound, in an apparent bit of sponsorship oddity, by a Budweiser Clydesdale.)	0
79nyt29	0	a	Moments later, she added, a bit regretfully: “I really am almost sad for myself that I have gone down this path with you, because I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it.	0
79nyt15	0	a	All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol.	0

25hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ― In a stinging blow to President Barack Obama, the Senate voted Wednesday to override his veto of a bill to let 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in the terrorist attacks.	0
25hpo14	0	a	It overrides the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which grants immunity to countries that aren’t designated state sponsors of terrorism.	0

78hpo25	0	a	"""The House interim report found that 'senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi' and that those changes were ultimately made,"" said Buck."	0
78fox23	0	a	While much has been made of the State Department's failure to respond to repeated security requests for extra help, a former diplomatic security agent and 20-year veteran of the department, who reviewed the publicly available documents on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News the multiple warnings present a compelling argument that State Department leadership was negligent.	0
78hpo26	0	a	"""Those findings are confirmed by the emails released today, and they contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points."	0
78hpo8	0	a	"They have criticized Nuland for requesting to remove a line from the final draft noting that there had been ""at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants."""	0
78nyt18	0	a	In an e-mail to Mr. Petraeus accompanying the final version of the talking points, Mr. Morell referred to the State Department’s deep concerns about the references.	0
78nyt7	0	a	While the e-mails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, they suggest that Mr. Obama’s aides mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the C.I.A. over how much to disclose — all under heavy time constraints because of the demands from Capitol Hill.	0
78hpo20	0	a	The timing of the White House's document release raises its own set of questions.	0
78fox1	0	a	"Draft ""talking points"" obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News depicted efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in the days after the attack to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi."	0
78nyt28	0	a	Ten minutes later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, offered his first comments, saying, “We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, especially the investigation.”	0
78hpo1	1	a	Nothing in the emails supports theories that the talking points were changed in order to influence the 2012 election.	1
78hpo2	0	a	In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.	0
78fox21	0	a	Records released by the House oversight committee, including a report from the regional security officer, also documented more than 200 cases of violence in Libya in the year leading up to the attack, specifically between June 2011 and July 2012.	0
78nyt3	0	a	Mr. Morell, officials said, acted on his own and not in response to pressure from the State Department.	0
78hpo15	0	a	"Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government ""know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,"" because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks."	0
78hpo11	1	a	Morell believed it was irrelevant to the message of the talking points -- what happened in Benghazi -- and unprofessional to include those warnings but not allow State Department officials to include how they had responded to them.	1
78fox16	0	a	After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not.	0
78nyt6	0	a	The White House released the e-mails to reporters after Republicans seized on snippets of the correspondence that became public on Friday to suggest that President Obama’s national security staff had been complicit in trying to alter the talking points for political reasons.	0
78nyt33	0	a	Over the next couple of hours, aides made small final changes and e-mailed a final version to lawmakers shortly after 3 p.m.	0
78fox20	0	a	In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law.	0
78nyt35	1	a	Asked by one of Ms. Rice’s aides, “Is this the final language you want to use on Benghazi,” Mr. Rhodes replied with a single word: “Yup.”	1
78hpo31	0	a	"""You can now see what the Congress has seen -- collectively these emails make clear that the interagency process, including the White House's interactions, were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation."	0
78nyt25	0	a	Twenty-three minutes later, Ms. Nuland sent White House and intelligence officials an even more pointed e-mail, objecting that the talking points could be “abused” by lawmakers “to beat the State Department for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either? Concerned ... ”	0
78nyt21	0	a	At 6:20 p.m., the spokesman for the National Security Council at the time, Tommy Vietor, e-mailed to remind officials that Denis McDonough, then the deputy national security adviser and now the White House chief of staff, wanted to ensure that the edits were coordinated with the State Department.	0
78hpo23	0	a	While the document dump does soften some of the more critical theories that have arisen with respect to the White House's handling of the events in Benghazi, it could also embolden critics who now see an administration willing to accommodate demands for documents.	0
78fox13	0	a	"""Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention,"" Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee."	0
78hpo32	0	a	After 11 hearings, 25,000 pages of documents, and now this release, we can hopefully spend our time working on what’s important – what we can do together to ensure those serving their nation overseas are better protected than they were last September.”	0
78nyt20	0	a	The process began in earnest at 4:20 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14, when Stephen W. Preston, the C.I.A. general counsel, sent an e-mail to other agency officials warning them not to disclose information that might interfere with the F.B.I.’s investigation.	0
78fox5	0	a	One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity.	0
78hpo7	1	a	Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism.	1
78fox14	0	a	"""I have made it very clear that the security cable did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level where the ARB (Accountability Review Board) placed responsibility where, as I think, Ambassador Pickering said the rubber hit the road."""	0
78hpo24	0	a	In a response shortly after the emails were made public on Wednesday, Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), said just that.	0
78nyt12	0	a	Republicans welcomed the release of the e-mails, saying they confirmed that the administration had airbrushed its account of the attack during an election campaign.	0
78fox9	1	a	In addition to identifying the presence of Al Qaeda and Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi, the groups ultimately blamed for the assault, a key section of the cable, which remains classified, seemed to foreshadow the attack itself.	1
78hpo30	0	a	"To make clear what is and is not in these e-mails, today the White House took the extraordinary step of releasing these e-mails,"" Schultz said."	0
78hpo10	0	a	But senior administration officials on Wednesday said that Michael J. Morell, then the deputy director of the CIA, also wanted that line removed, separately from Nuland.	0
78hpo17	0	a	"For example, CIA officials also decided to change the phrase ""attacks in Benghazi ... evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate"" to ""demonstrations in Benghazi"" because they believed ""attacks"" and ""assault"" were synonymous, making the phrase illogical."	0
78nyt34	0	a	With time short before Ms. Rice began taping her appearances on Sunday morning news programs, the White House also supplied her aides with the final talking points.	0
78nyt22	0	a	At 6:41 p.m., Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, suggested saying that on Sept. 10, the C.I.A. had “notified” the American embassy in Cairo, not “warned” it, of social media reports calling for a demonstration and encouraging jihadists to break into the embassy.	0
78fox22	0	a	"Another security review, on June 25, 2012, reported a spike in violence with ""foreigners also increasingly targeted."""	0
78nyt16	1	a	It drew attention to a draft of the talking points — the only document provided by the White House that was not part of an e-mail chain — in which Mr. Morell, in his own writing, crossed out five lines that referred to C.I.A. warnings about the threat of attacks by Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Benghazi and eastern Libya.	1
78nyt15	0	a	In releasing the e-mails, the White House was hoping to show that intelligence officials, not political advisers, drove the debate over the talking points.	0
78hpo22	0	a	If the material was too sensitive to share publicly months, weeks or days ago, what changed on Wednesday?	0
78hpo19	0	a	A reference to another terrorist group, Ansar al-Sharia, was left in, but later removed at the request of the State Department; the CIA agreed with that decision, again so as not to hinder the FBI investigation.	0
78hpo5	0	a	In particular, they pointed to the fact that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed.	0
78nyt9	0	a	“In recent days, these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media,” said a White House spokesman, Eric Schultz.	0
78nyt24	0	a	At 7:16 p.m., Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, weighed in with her initial concerns about ensuring that the talking points provided to lawmakers did not go further than what the administration was telling reporters.	0
78fox11	0	a	During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.	0
78hpo18	0	a	CIA officers also removed the reference to al Qaeda in order to avoid prejudging the outcome of a FBI investigation into the incident.	0
78fox18	0	a	"Graham said: ""She said she didn't. Are you stunned that she didn't?"""	0

78nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — E-mails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal jostling over the government’s official talking points in the aftermath of last September’s attack in Benghazi, Libya, not only between the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, but at the highest levels of the C.I.A.	0
78nyt5	1	a	“This is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get,” Mr. Petraeus wrote, referring to Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which had asked Mr. Petraeus for talking points to use with reporters in discussing the attack on Benghazi.	1
78fox24	1	a	"The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials ""demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability"" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct."	1

78fox0	0	a	The resurgent controversy over the Obama administration's initial story-line on the Benghazi attack underscores State Department concerns about the leadership's failure to act on documented warnings and security incidents.	0
78hpo29	0	a	“Despite the fact that e-mails relating to the Benghazi talking points were made available to members of Congress several months ago, in recent days these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media.	0

78nyt2	1	a	Mr. Morell, administration officials said, deleted a reference in the draft version of the talking points to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them.	1
78fox7	0	a	The cable also warned that the 17 February Brigade, the group charged with protecting the consulate, appeared to be compromised.	0
78nyt1	0	a	The 100 pages of e-mails showed a disagreement between David H. Petraeus, then the director of the C.I.A., and his deputy, Michael J.

78nyt10	0	a	By releasing them, he said, the White House had shown that the drafting process was “focused on providing the facts as we knew them, based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation.”	0

8nyt6	1	a	Mr. Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Intelligence committees, has used his time in Congress to burnish his foreign policy credits and cast himself as a defense hawk: a position that could help him stand out in a crowded primary field.	1
8hpo9	1	a	The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has challenged Obama's efforts to normalize diplomatic relations with the island, saying that closer ties would only help the communist Castro government keep power.	1
8fox14	0	a	“Okay. So here’s Rubio’s alleged ‘new’ foreign policy.	0
8nyt3	0	a	The Rubio approach, according to excerpts from his speech provided by his campaign, has three main pillars — ensuring American strength; protecting the American economy in a globalized world; and preserving the moral clarity of America’s core values.	0
8hpo1	0	a	In comments delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, the conservative senator vying for the GOP presidential nomination said the world would be safer if the U.S. military had a bigger budget and America asserted itself more aggressively across the globe.	0

8hpo3	0	a	"""President Kennedy, like most presidents before and since, understood what I believe our current president does not: that American strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it,” Rubio said."	0
8hpo14	0	a	Rubio also told Rose he would not have authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein's regine if he knew Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction.	0
8fox35	0	a	He said having anything to do with Cuba is to avail oneself of properties stolen from Cubans by the Cuban government during the revolution.	0
8fox33	0	a	Rubio said his priorities and those of the pope's are by necessity different.	0
8fox32	0	a	Rose asked Rubio what he though of Pope Francis's embrace of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba.	0

8fox36	0	a	Rubio said the embargo is not to blame for Cuba's failed economy.	0
8fox23	1	a	"Rubio said Obama ""wasted no time stripping parts from the engine of American strength,"" and cast former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as his loyal deputy."	1
8fox26	1	a	He even has taken tougher stances on foreign policy than some of his Republican colleagues, who have softened their views on diplomatic relations with Cuba – to which Rubio objects – and how to handle the nuclear talks with Iran.	1
8fox2	0	a	“Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American strength has not,” Rubio said.	0

8fox7	1	a	Rubio repeated his characterization of Obama as a president so concerned with softening any perception other nations has of the United States as a bully that he erred in acting in the other extreme, eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that have thumbed their noses at the U.S. and international laws.	1
8hpo6	1	a	"""He entered office believing America was too hard on our adversaries, too engaged in too many places, and that if we just took a step back and did some more 'nation building at home' -- ceding leadership to other countries -- America would be better liked and the world better off."""	1

8fox38	0	a	So why, he asked, does Cuba not have Toyotas or modern goods from other nations?	0
8hpo5	1	a	"""Sadly, I believe President Obama often disagrees with that simple truth,"" Rubio added."	1

99nyt0	1	a	WASHINGTON — Representative Duncan Hunter was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego on Tuesday after a monthslong criminal investigation into allegations that he spent tens of thousands of dollars in campaign funds on family trips to Hawaii and Italy, private school tuition for his children and even a $600 airline ticket for a pet rabbit.	1
99fox13	0	a	“According to the indictment, the Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.	0
99hpo17	0	a	“The Republicans left in California are pretty well-liked by their constituents,” he said.	0
99nyt3	0	a	Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, was indicted on insider trading charges, and announced days later that he had suspended his re-election campaign.	0
99nyt13	0	a	At the very least, the indictment will require Republicans to spend money to defend the seat.	0
99fox5	0	a	"Vega contended that there was a ""rush to indict"" after a two-year grand jury investigation."	0
99nyt11	0	a	Mr. Hunter easily won California’s nonpartisan primary with 48 percent of the vote; the next highest vote-getter, Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Democrat, took only 17 percent.	0
99fox1	0	a	In response, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday evening that he would remove the congressman from all committee assignments for the time being, calling the charges against Hunter “deeply serious.”	0
99fox4	0	a	Fox News obtained a letter sent from Hunter's attorney, Gregory A. Vega, to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein on Aug. 6 asking him to postpone the indictment.	0

99fox0	0	a	Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and his wife, Margaret, were indicted on charges of illegally converting $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and filing false records, prosecutors announced Tuesday.	0
99nyt8	0	a	The back-to-back indictments are all but certain to give ammunition to Democrats, who have been promising to clean up corruption in Washington if voters give them control of the House.	0
99nyt5	0	a	Mr. Collins, who is accused of passing insider information to his son about a drug company on whose board he served, has said he expects to be “fully vindicated and exonerated.”	0
99hpo2	0	a	The Justice Department said the pair used political money to pay for their children’s tuition and spent thousands of dollars at shopping malls, Washington restaurants and surf shops, among other expenditures.	0
99nyt12	0	a	Despite that, Democrats have long thought they could make a play for Mr. Hunter’s seat, especially if he were indicted.	0
99nyt7	0	a	Mr. Vega, anticipating an indictment, asserted in the letter that two prosecutors involved in the investigation had attended a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton, and complained that bringing charges so close to the election would effectively deliver a “solidly Republican” House seat into Democratic hands.	0
99fox3	0	a	The indictment also alleged that the pair spent “tens of thousands of dollars” on items ranging from movie tickets, fast food, golf outings, groceries and home utilities.	0
99nyt17	0	a	The department said that the improper use of campaign funds continued despite “numerous warnings” and “repeated inquiries” from Mr. Hunter’s campaign treasurer about questionable purchases.	0
99hpo8	0	a	He repaid his campaign more than $60,000 earlier this year for improper expenses dating back to 2015, but the FBI began investigation additional charges dating back as far as 2009, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.	0
99hpo6	1	a	Hunter had blamed his wife, who acted as a campaign manager, for many of the improper charges, saying she controlled the campaign’s credit card, and in February he feigned ignorance in an interview with Politico, saying: “Nah, I know the rules.”	1
99fox15	0	a	The pair is due to be arraigned in court on Thursday morning.	0
99nyt18	1	a	“The indictment alleges that Congressman Hunter and his wife repeatedly dipped into campaign coffers as if they were personal bank accounts, and falsified F.E.C. campaign finance reports to cover their tracks,” Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement, referring to the Federal Election Commission.	1
99nyt2	0	a	Mr. Hunter, 41, becomes the second Republican congressman to be indicted this month.	0
99hpo11	1	a	In a speech earlier this month, Hunter echoed President Donald Trump and castigated the Justice Department, accusing the agency of being “corrupt, answerable to no one” and said it “uses the law to extort the American people and effect political change.”	1
99nyt25	0	a	Theater tickets were mischaracterized as “holiday gift certificates.”	0
99fox7	0	a	He also claimed bias from prosecutors in the Southern District of California who supported Hillary Clinton's candidacy.	0
99nyt9	0	a	And for California Republicans, it has immediate implications, expanding from seven to eight the field of Republican-held seats being seriously targeted by Democrats.	0
99nyt21	0	a	Beyond the family vacations and private school tuition, the indictment said expenses included dental work, theater tickets, and domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, as well as “tens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases, including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities and expensive meals,” according to a statement released by the Justice Department.	0

99fox11	0	a	Charges included conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, wire fraud and falsifying records.	0
99hpo5	0	a	His family has been a household name in California politics for decades, and his father, also named Duncan Hunter, served in the U.S. House for nearly 30 years until handing the reins to his son.	0
99hpo7	0	a	“And if I did” spend campaign funds improperly, he said, “it was an accident and I paid it back.”	0
99nyt30	0	a	By March 2017, when the Justice Department opened its criminal investigation, Mr. Hunter was already being investigated by the House Ethics Committee.	0
99hpo3	0	a	The indictment includes details accusing the Hunters of making efforts to hide their personal expenses, including labeling fees for dental work as a donation to a charity called “Smiles for Life” and tickets to see Riverdance as a fundraising event for “Republican women.”	0
99nyt27	0	a	The Hunters are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in San Diego.	0
99fox8	0	a	The congressman's lawyers said in 2017 that Hunter and his wife repaid the campaign about $60,000.	0
99nyt23	0	a	To conceal their personal spending, the Hunters mischaracterized the purchases as “campaign travel,” “dinner with volunteers/contributors,” “toy drives,” “teacher/parent and supporter events,” “gift cards” for charitable donations and “gift basket items,” the statement said.	0
99hpo10	0	a	“The Hunters knew that many of their desired purchases could be made only by using campaign funds, since they did not otherwise have sufficient personal funds to pay for their purchases.”	0
99fox9	0	a	Prosecutors said Hunter and his wife “mischaracterized” the purchases in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings to hide the illicit spending.	0
99nyt15	1	a	“Today’s indictment confirms just how deep this corruption can reach when someone like Duncan Hunter Jr. is in it for himself instead of representing the people.”	1
99fox10	0	a	“Family dental bills paid with campaign funds were characterized as a charitable contribution to ‘Smiles for Life,’” the press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said as an example.	0
99hpo16	0	a	He said polling had him safely above his opponent — “We’re looking good” — and he indicated he wasn’t really afraid of losing.	0
99nyt29	0	a	He was for a time considered as a possible choice for defense secretary or another top job in the Trump administration, and told The San Diego Union-Tribune days after Mr. Trump’s election that he wanted to restore “a warrior culture, a warrior mentality” to the government.	0
99nyt10	0	a	Mr. Hunter cannot take his name off the ballot, according to a spokesman for the California secretary of state, and California does not allow write-in candidates.	0
99fox2	0	a	Among the allegations named in the 48-page indictment included instances between 2009 and 2016 when Hunter and his wife used campaign funds to pay for family vacations to Italy and Hawaii, school tuition, dental work, and even domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives, according to a press release from the Southern District of California’s U.S. Attorney’s Office.	0
99hpo9	0	a	“The goal of the conspiracy was for Duncan Hunter and Margaret Hunter to enrich themselves, and others at their direction, by converting campaign funds for their own personal benefit and enjoyment,” the 47-page indictment says.	0

91hpo47	0	a	The question, in some respects, is not what's missing from the set of ideas, but what took the administration so long to get to this point.	0
91fox2	0	a	Already facing stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, the president called on Congress to pass several major changes to the country's current gun laws -- some of which are already being considered like the restrictions on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.	0

91nyt32	0	a	With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time.	0

91fox20	1	a	"Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., accused Obama of trying to ""undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms"" without doing enough to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill."	1
91fox8	1	a	The president was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting in which 20 children were killed.	1
91fox17	0	a	The administration plans to give private sellers guidance on how to run background checks as soon as possible.	0
91hpo9	0	a	Those actions include requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system; providing law enforcement officials, first responders and school officials with better training for active shooting situations; directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence; and many more.	0

91nyt4	0	a	Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort.	0

12fox1	0	a	The National Rifle Association called Tuesday for state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds once they've gone through extensive training, as part of a set of recommendations that capped a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting.	0

12hpo3	0	a	The report was prepared by a 12-person task force, called the School Shield Program, led by Hutchinson.	0

12hpo13	0	a	Hutchinson's report and his press conference were both met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which supports broader gun control measures and strongly opposes arming educators.	0
12hpo5	0	a	"""Teachers should teach, but if there is personnel that has interest and is willing to go through 40 to 60 hours of [firearms] training, then schools should be willing to [arm them],"" Hutchinson said."	0
12hpo7	0	a	The task force recommended that schools designate willing staff to be armed and trained, and it proposed a model training program, 40-60 hours per person, at what Hutchinson said would be a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee.	0
12hpo25	0	a	"""You can address assault weapons, but it doesn't stop violence in schools."	0

14nyt32	0	a	Then a curfew was imposed. The next night, there was no curfew.	0

40nyt27	0	a	It wasn’t the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash.	0
40hpo31	0	a	Instead, he got the aggressive label.	0
40nyt15	1	a	His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the camera.	1
40hpo42	0	a	"""Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics,"" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina."	0
40nyt3	0	a	Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the economy.	0
40hpo60	0	a	The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan’s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.	0
40nyt23	0	a	Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his predecessor’s mistakes.	0
40hpo23	0	a	Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election.	0
40hpo47	0	a	"He raised the issue of Romney’s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could “never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."""	0
40fox8	0	a	"""These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,"" Biden said, adding he's ""had it up to here"" with those kinds of comments."	0

40fox33	0	a	Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.	0
40fox5	1	a	But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged.	1
40nyt17	0	a	“On two occasions, we — we — we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants,” Mr. Ryan said stiffly.	0
40fox0	0	a	In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions.	0
40fox16	0	a	The tightening was reflected in the candidates' attitude onstage Thursday, each loath to give the other too many seconds of speech-time without a challenge.	0
40fox6	1	a	Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not.	1
40hpo35	1	a	Biden: smirking, mocking, immature.”	1
40nyt2	0	a	And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleague’s 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle.	0
40fox1	0	a	The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes.	0
40hpo25	0	a	But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard.	0
40fox27	1	a	"... Not a single thing he said is accurate."""	1
40fox18	0	a	Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody.	0
40fox13	0	a	"""This is not what a real recovery looks like,"" Ryan said."	0
40nyt0	0	a	Joe Biden knew Lloyd Bentsen.	0

40fox47	0	a	"After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a ""happy warrior"" for the middle class."	0
40hpo22	1	a	Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years.	1
40fox21	0	a	With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack.	0

40fox28	0	a	"He added: ""This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about."""	0
40hpo29	0	a	At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought.	0
40hpo37	0	a	“Most people probably found the vice president’s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,” said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.	0
40hpo38	0	a	But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.	0
40fox38	0	a	The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail.	0
40hpo4	0	a	But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week.	0
40nyt21	0	a	“I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don’t come out of your mouth the right way,” he said with a gotcha smile.	0

40hpo52	1	a	Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts.	1
40hpo56	0	a	Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.	0
40hpo28	1	a	"""Not a single thing he said is accurate,"" Biden said."	1
40fox10	0	a	"""But I always say what I mean,"" Biden responded."	0
40fox41	0	a	"Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a ""debt crisis is coming"" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit."	0

40fox7	0	a	"Notably, he hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly videotaped comment in which he said he doesn't have to worry about the ""47 percent"" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes."	0
40hpo20	0	a	Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.	0
40hpo33	0	a	Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Miller called Biden “unhinged.”	0
40hpo49	0	a	Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring.	0
40hpo0	1	a	DANVILLE, Ky. –- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more.	1
40nyt6	0	a	Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama’s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as “my friend” but dismissing his arguments as “malarkey.”	0
40fox26	1	a	"Biden was quick to retort: ""With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey."	1
40hpo26	0	a	It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president.	0
40hpo53	1	a	But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides.	1
40fox32	0	a	After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge.	0
40hpo16	0	a	By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans.	0
40fox42	0	a	"""That's what we get in this administration -- speeches."	0
40hpo8	0	a	“He had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate.	0
40hpo57	0	a	Biden didn’t worry so much about numbers.	0

40hpo51	0	a	Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.	0
40hpo12	0	a	"I hope he is [reassured],"" Axelrod said, adding that he had ""high regard for [Sullivan] by the way."""	0
40fox35	0	a	"On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto ""voucher"" system."	0
40nyt13	0	a	This time he let loose.	0
40nyt8	0	a	It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night.	0
40fox20	0	a	"""What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,"" Ryan said."	0
40fox17	0	a	The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central.	0
40fox45	0	a	The latest Fox News national poll of likely voters showed Romney edging Obama, 46 percent to 45 percent.	0
40hpo18	0	a	“He was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people.	0
40hpo59	0	a	He acknowledged that Romney’s Medicare plan would not cost seniors an extra $6,400 a year, despite the claim in a recently launched Obama campaign ad.	0
40fox22	0	a	"""This is becoming more troubling by the day."	0
40hpo1	0	a	The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.	0
40hpo43	0	a	"""You're going to do that when you've lost a debate."	0
40fox25	0	a	Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected.	0
40hpo58	0	a	Biden’s argument on Medicare was aimed at voters’ guts, much more so than minds.	0
40fox36	0	a	"""Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare,"" he said."	0
40nyt14	1	a	And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts.	1
40hpo7	1	a	Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.	1
40fox39	0	a	On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it.	0
40hpo6	1	a	"""I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,"" the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida."	1
40fox3	0	a	If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.	0
40nyt16	0	a	Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his own district.	0
40hpo54	0	a	“Stop talking about how you care about people.	0
40fox24	0	a	"Now they're trying to blame the Romney/Ryan ticket for making this an issue,"" he said."	0
40nyt7	1	a	He laughed at Mr. Ryan’s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent.	1
40nyt18	0	a	“I love that. I love that,” Mr. Biden said.	0
40fox14	0	a	Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen.	0
40hpo14	0	a	"The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed ""passion"" and that he showed ""a great concern for the middle class."""	0
40hpo61	0	a	Biden, aware of this, told voters they should be suspicious somebody “who would actually put in motion a plan that … added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?”	0
40fox19	0	a	Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack.	0
40nyt4	0	a	Mr. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin and said to Ryan, after waiting a beat to let the moment sink in, “So, now you’re Jack Kennedy?”	0
40hpo10	0	a	No one represented that Democratic angst more than blogger Andrew Sullivan, a supporter of the president.	0
40fox48	0	a	The final presidential debates will be held Oct. 16 and Oct. 22.	0
40fox11	0	a	"Ryan accused Obama of ""projecting weakness"" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya."	0
40fox31	0	a	The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate.	0
40nyt25	0	a	She seemed determined to be less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the Obama-Romney debate.	0
40fox2	1	a	But it was the vice president who set the aggressive tone, blatantly striving to hit the reset after President Obama was panned for his lackluster performance at last week's opening debate.	1
40hpo36	0	a	Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Biden’s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining.	0
40nyt9	1	a	Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare.	1
40fox12	0	a	At home, he accused the administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery.	0
3fox28	0	a	"She called the estate tax provision ""a bridge too far."""	0
3fox1	0	a	"""To pass this bill in the next couple of weeks would materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,"" he told reporters at the White House."	0
3fox2	1	a	Summers added that he thinks Congress will pass the deal President Obama struck with Republicans, an agreement that has come under withering criticism from liberal Democrats over the two-year extension of tax cuts for the rich as well as the middle class.	1
3fox23	0	a	"And a number of us are just saying that's enough."""	0
3hpo20	1	a	If anything, the pitch being offered from the administration to the rest of the party was: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.	1
3hpo9	0	a	"""A double dip would come out of the reality of a relatively contractionary fiscal policy..."	0
3fox17	0	a	"""There does not seem to be a majority of the Democrats who support the deal negotiated by Vice President Biden,"" he told Fox News."	0
3nyt20	0	a	That is on top of projections that currently are in the range of 2 percent to 3 percent.	0
3hpo2	0	a	"""If they [Democrats] don't pass this bill in the next couple weeks it will materially increase the risk that the economy would stall out and we would have a double dip,"" he told a gathering of reporters at an off camera briefing."	0
3nyt28	0	a	“I’m not going to vote for it.	0
3fox11	1	a	Both provisions are seen by many Democrats as giveaways to the rich that will do little to help the economy.	1
3nyt26	0	a	In the House, Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday morning that the sense of disappointment with the president remained strong.	0
3fox18	0	a	"""So we want to have a record vote in the caucus on a resolution that says this resolution should not go to the floor without a majority of Democratic votes."""	0
3nyt1	0	a	Mr. Summers made the remarks at a briefing with the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs and David Axelrod, the president’s top political adviser.	0
3fox13	0	a	Workers would also see their share of Social Security payroll taxes cut by nearly a third for the coming year, a boost in take-home pay meant to encourage spending and aid the economy.	0
3nyt21	0	a	But the public relations offensive is being met with public expressions of outrage from Mr. Obama’s base, including the most liberal members of Congress and spokesmen for interest groups on the left.	0
3hpo15	0	a	Stabilizing the housing market, however, is not on the current congressional docket.	0
3fox5	0	a	Sen. Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, told reporters that a tax cut bill could be on the Senate floor as early as Thursday.	0
3nyt19	0	a	Macroeconomic Advisors, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs projected smaller increases but no less than at least 0.5 percentage point.	0
3fox24	0	a	Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans.	0
3hpo18	0	a	Asked, for instance, if the White House would be willing to revise the informal compromise to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said any changes would be fine, so long as they didn't result in decreased support.	0
3hpo12	0	a	But the issue is, that the deal certainly is not enough to lift the economy to a different place.	0
3nyt2	0	a	The administration has been pushing back hard against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans.	0
3nyt4	0	a	“I just think it’s very important for Congress to examine the agreement, look at the facts, have a thorough debate, but get this done.	0
3hpo19	0	a	"Then he cautioned: ""The physics and the blood and the sweat that might be involved in that, I'm not entirely sure I would put it quite as simply as that."""	0
3fox12	1	a	In return, Democrats would get extended jobless benefits for people who have been unemployed for long stretches.	1
3hpo3	0	a	A double dip recession?	0
3fox4	0	a	Positive reviews coming in from economists, Summers said, show the deal is the right thing to do.	0
3hpo28	1	a	"Added Gibbs: ""I think you would really have to ask somebody who says... lets have some eight week fight and on February the 15th come in and say, alright, now we are ready to make a compromise, who on earth, who on earth thinks that that is somehow going to be a fundamentally better agreement than the one we are looking at right now?"	1
3nyt15	0	a	John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a close ally of Mr. Obama, issued a statement calling the tax deal “a steep price” but saying the president was “right to choose helping working Americans over a December conflagration.” 	0
3nyt9	0	a	Officials said Mr. Biden will travel to the Hill around 4:30 p.m. in an attempt to sell the compromise Mr. Obama announced this week.	0
3hpo16	0	a	And on Wednesday, the White House began a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats -- skeptical, as they are, about an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax.	0
3nyt29	1	a	I don’t feel that I should be coerced.”	1
3hpo26	0	a	We, I think we all stipulate, the president did, no one likes those provisions that they dislike but on the other side of the ledger are significant things that will help people and help the economy.	0
3hpo13	0	a	Will we see what happened with the large stimulus happen here, which is once the stimulus is over the economy returns to slow growth? That's the danger.	0
3hpo4	0	a	"""What I said it would significantly increase the risk,"" Summers replied."	0
3nyt14	0	a	The Democratic National Committee alerted reporters that Jennifer Granholm, the Democratic governor of Michigan, also supports the deal.	0
3hpo1	1	a	It wasn't quite the metaphorical flare of mushroom cloud imagery, but outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a fairly dire assessment of the stakes in the tax cut debate.	1
3fox22	0	a	And they're trying to get us to jam it through again.	0
3fox27	0	a	"""So far, the response has not been very good,"" Pelosi said."	0
3fox19	0	a	DeFazio said House Democrats aren't going to keep rubber-stamping deals they don't like.	0
3nyt12	0	a	To counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress, the White House circulated a series of e-mails quoting endorsements from private-sector economic forecasters, liberal as well as conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders, including an obscure freshman House member, Representative Gary Peters of Michigan.	0
3nyt24	0	a	Mr. Biden’s visit with the House Democrats is likely to be as contentious as the one that he led with their Senate colleagues on Tuesday — if not more so.	0
3nyt25	0	a	Despite the closed-door lunchtime meeting, Senate aides told The Times afterward that about 30 Democratic senators remained “firmly opposed” to the president’s negotiated deal after hearing from the vice president.	0
3nyt5	0	a	The American people are watching, and they’re expecting action on our parts,” Mr. Obama said.	0
3nyt10	0	a	It will be the second time in two days that Mr. Biden has served as the liaison-in-chief for the White House.	0
3hpo22	0	a	"""Do they have a sense of how this ends and how long will that take, because as Larry said there are real consequences to that."	0
3fox14	0	a	Liberals are going as far as trying to prevent outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing the tax cut compromise to the floor.	0
3hpo6	0	a	Summers himself, downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts back in September -- though he was speaking, then, about the rates for the rich and the tax cut deal, at that point in time, did not include money for a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance or other tax incentives to help lower income workers.	0
3hpo25	0	a	And so there are real consequences to that decision.	0
3nyt3	0	a	In brief remarks after meeting with President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland, Mr. Obama on Wednesday emphatically disputed that Democrats generally feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans on the tax cuts, saying that “the more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense.”	0
3nyt18	0	a	The administration was quick to highlight comments from Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’sEconomy.com, projecting that the Obama tax deal would increase economic growth next year by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.6 million jobs.	0
3nyt22	1	a	Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter from Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, calling the tax deal “fiscally irresponsible” and “grossly unfair.”	1
3fox10	0	a	Some Democrats are unhappy that Obama agreed to extend expiring tax cuts not just for the middle class but also for higher earners, and that he agreed to impose a lower estate tax on wealthy heirs.	0
3nyt0	0	a	Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, just told a group of reporters that failure to pass a package like the tax deal announced by President Obama this week “would significantly increase the risk” of a double-dip recession.	0
3nyt23	0	a	The letter says Mr. Obama “should not back down. Nor should we.”	0
3nyt17	0	a	David Axelrod, the president’s chief political adviser, said on CNN’s “American Morning” that middle-class Americans were “going to get screwed” if their tax cuts were not extended at the end of the year.	0
3hpo11	0	a	And it ought to boost growth by some increment...	0
3hpo7	0	a	Asked whether the country would find itself dipping towards the economic doldrums if Congress waited a month or two to get a tax cut package passed, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official in the Clinton White House and a proponent of the current tax cut deal, offered more sober-minded analysis.	0
3hpo5	1	a	The message was hardly subtle. But it certainly was debatable.	1
3fox25	0	a	"Speaking to reporters at a joint appearance with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, Obama said economists predict higher job growth in 2011 and 2012 if Congress passes the agreement and urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and ""get this done."""	0
3fox8	0	a	"Kyl said an official analysis and price tag, referred to as a ""score,"" from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are not yet ready, but that the Senate could move to the bill anyway."	0
3fox7	0	a	Durbin would not detail what those changes are, deferring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.	0
3nyt11	0	a	Mr. Biden’s visit and the president’s comments come as the administration’s message machine started churning out statements of support.	0
3fox16	0	a	They're hoping to get 60 signatures on their letter and then force a vote in the caucus.	0
3hpo24	0	a	We know that on January 1 people's taxes will go up, we know that at the end of this month 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance.	0

3fox0	0	a	Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned Wednesday that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession.	0
3fox15	0	a	Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, and Jim McDermott and Jay Inslee of Washington state are crafting a letter to share with the House Democratic Caucus that would try to block the bill from seeing the light of day.	0
3hpo27	0	a	"And what we know for sure is that without any of it we are facing a really difficult situation."""	0
3hpo23	0	a	Just as the forecasts went up on the basis of this agreement they will go down if this agreement fails. That we know.	0
3nyt7	0	a	In a joint appearance at the White House with Mr. Komorowski, Mr. Obama said that “economists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth” after the tax deal was announced on Monday night.	0

86nyt3	0	a	Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers.	0
86nyt28	0	a	Among his other concerns, Mr. Mattis viewed the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and as ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran.	0
86hpo28	0	a	Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year, and Tom Price stepped aside as secretary of health and human services last fall amid ethical questions about his travel practices.	0
86nyt26	1	a	Mr. Mattis was the primary author of a new American defense strategy whose central goal was to take on “revisionist” powers — an approach that some of Mr. Trump’s former advisers say the president never fully comprehended.	1
86nyt37	0	a	Though a colorful, hard-charging advocate of aggressive offensive action, Mr. Mattis viewed a tough American posture overseas as a way to deter war, not to start them, with potential foes like Iran.	0
86nyt1	0	a	Mr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States’ 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president.	0
86nyt7	0	a	“Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.”	0

86fox6	1	a	Also on Thursday, Trump had said Mattis -- the first Cabinet official in 40 years to resign over a stated policy difference with the president -- was leaving in February.	1
86nyt19	1	a	It was also the first resignation over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state.	1
86nyt23	0	a	He said the core of American national interests lay in “providing effective leadership to our alliances,” and specifically described the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance Mr. Trump has often derided.	0

86fox11	0	a	U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, and Trump later tweeted that “we have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.”	0

95nyt2	0	a	But they noticed that among the 15,000 documents they examined, there were no emails to or from an official departmental account for Mrs. Clinton.	0

95hpo5	0	a	Clinton, who is often described as the Democratic presidential frontrunner for 2016, has faced scrutiny since Monday when The New York Times reported that she may have violated federal records law by using a personal email account for all of her work messages as secretary of state.	0
95fox3	0	a	Instead, the paper reports, Clinton's advisers selected which of her emails to turn over to the State Department for archival purposes after going through tens of thousands of pages of correspondence.	0
95hpo4	1	a	"""It’s a stunning record of secrecy and corruption, of cronyism run amok."""	1
95nyt7	0	a	The decision to ask Mrs. Clinton for her emails went all the way to Secretary of State John Kerry’s chief of staff, who, along with officials working on the response to the Benghazi requests, signed off on it.	0
95fox28	0	a	The Wall Street Journal reported late Sunday that she was expected to formally launch her candidacy next month.	0
95nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — As State Department lawyers sifted last summer through a new batch of documents related to the Benghazi attacks, they repeatedly saw something that caught their attention: emails sent to and from a personal account for Hillary Rodham Clinton.	0
95nyt8	0	a	Beginning in August, senior State Department officials held negotiations with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers and advisers to gain access to her personal email records.	0
95hpo10	0	a	While on Mitchell's show, McCain also raised the concern that there's no way of knowing if all of Clinton's emails have been saved, since they were not originally retained by the government.	0
95fox26	1	a	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who released 250,000 emails from his gubernatorial tenure this past December, tweeted about the contrast between his disclosures and Clinton's secrecy.	1
95fox4	0	a	The department said late Monday that it had received 55,000 pages of Clinton's emails as part of a request made to previous secretaries of state to turn over any official documents they may have had in their possession.	0
95hpo8	0	a	But likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush suggested that the use of personal email demonstrated a lack of transparency.	0
95hpo0	1	a	He may have a personal fondness for her, but Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) suggested Thursday that Hillary Clinton’s exclusive use of personal email while serving as secretary of state was hypocritical. 	1
95fox1	0	a	The existence of the account was discovered by the House select committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and was first reported by The New York Times.	0
95nyt28	0	a	The spokeswoman, Marie Harf, was asked on Tuesday whether there was any connection between the requests from Congress and the decision to ask the former secretaries of state for emails from their personal accounts.	0
95nyt13	0	a	Three weeks ago, the State Department handed over the Benghazi emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina.	0
95nyt16	0	a	Late Wednesday night, two days after The New York Times first reported that she had exclusively used a personal email account as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton announced that she had asked the State Department to release those communications.	0
95hpo1	0	a	“This is the same individual that just excoriated the Bush administration for supposedly hiding communications within the administration,” McCain said on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.”	0
95fox27	0	a	Clinton is widely believed to be the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in 2016.	0
95nyt4	0	a	Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman and the State Department have cast her decision to hand over her emails as motivated by efforts to update the department’s record management system.	0
95nyt24	0	a	Sensitive information is different from classified information.	0
95fox0	0	a	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used a personal email account to exclusively conduct official business during her time at the State Department, a move that raises questions about access to the full archive of her correspondence, as well as the possibility that she violated federal law requiring official messages to be retained for the record.	0
95fox11	0	a	"Harf added that the department turned over about 300 emails to the Benghazi select committee, and noted that Clinton's successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, ""is the first ... to rely primarily on a state.gov email account."""	0
95nyt31	1	a	Ms. Harf said that Mrs. Clinton was the only secretary of state who had sent back copies of emails.	1
95nyt19	0	a	They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.”	0
95fox23	0	a	Baron added that the use of private e-mail accounts is meant to be reserved only for emergencies, such as when a department's server is not working or compromised.	0
95nyt23	0	a	While the State Department has said there does not appear to be any classified material in Mrs. Clinton’s emails, officials said on Thursday that they needed to go through the trove again to determine whether it contained any “sensitive” information.	0
95nyt26	0	a	One State Department official said that if many lawyers were dedicated to the project, it could be completed in several weeks.	0
95nyt25	0	a	It can be personal data, like Social Security numbers, or information on matters that other countries consider classified or important to their national security.	0

95fox18	0	a	"He said the administration policy is that employees ""should use their official email accounts when they're conducting official government business."""	0
95hpo7	0	a	Democrats came to her defense, and other media outlets soon pointed out that the rules against using personal email were not relayed to government officials until 2014.	0
95nyt3	0	a	“This all raised the question to us: What else are we missing, and what do we need to comply” with the request, said one official briefed on the matter.	0
95fox6	0	a	Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said the former secretary of state expected that emails to State Department officials -- which she sent to department accounts -- would be preserved.	0
95fox17	0	a	White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was peppered with questions at Tuesday's briefing.	0
95fox24	0	a	However, The Times reports that the imposition of penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare because the National Archives has so few enforcement mechanisms.	0
95nyt30	0	a	“It went in October of 2014 — that was before we had gotten a request from the committee — as part of our records-maintenance upgrading and the process we go through.”	0
95fox25	0	a	The report has drawn heavy criticism from Republicans, including at least one potential challenger in the 2016 presidential race.	0
95hpo11	1	a	"""The question that I think's gonna rise over time is, how can we be confident that once she carries out what she tweeted -- that she wants all the emails known -- how are we gonna know that?"	1
95nyt12	0	a	Those documents were then examined by department lawyers, who found roughly 900 pages pertaining to the Benghazi attacks.	0
95nyt6	0	a	But it was the review of Benghazi-related documents last summer that, within the State Department, set off the chain of events leading to the public disclosure this week of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email account, according to the current and former department officials.	0
95nyt18	0	a	“I asked State to release them.	0

95fox13	1	a	Clinton and her aides reportedly did not follow that requirement at the time -- until her office turned over documents.	1
95fox5	1	a	It is not clear how many total emails from that period were in Clinton's personal account, nor is it clear how Clinton's advisers decided which emails to hand over to the State Department.	1
95fox21	0	a	Records officials interviewed by The Times expressed grave concern over Clinton's practice, saying it represents a severe ethical breach and noting that personal email accounts are far less secure than official ones.	0
95hpo3	1	a	"""We know about the secret wiretaps, we know about the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts,"" she said."	1
95nyt17	1	a	“I want the public to see my email,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in a Twitter post shortly before midnight, addressing the issue publicly for the first time.	1
95fox12	0	a	According to the Times, however, while past secretaries of state often used personal email, updated regulations required such emails to be preserved.	0
95nyt5	0	a	“When the department asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,” Nick Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, said on Sunday.	0
95fox22	0	a	"Jason Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, told the paper he found it ""very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business."""	0
95nyt21	0	a	That process could take several months, officials said, because different parts of the State Department must weigh in on whether information should be redacted.	0
95nyt9	0	a	At one point, her advisers met face-to-face with department officials in Washington.	0

59nyt12	0	a	Between public statements and news conferences, the staffs of the president and the speaker have been in close contact.	0

59nyt24	0	a	Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American “pragmatism” would prevail and avert the worst outcome.	0
59fox13	0	a	However, a growing number of Republicans are suggesting the party should give Obama what he wants on tax rates -- and focus instead on winning entitlement cuts once that is cleared away.	0
59fox17	0	a	Corker suggested that Republicans instead focus on extracting entitlement cuts as part of the debt-ceiling negotiations.	0

59fox20	0	a	Corker said that if the president wants to raise the debt limit by $2 trillion, Republicans should press for $2 trillion in spending cuts.	0
59fox9	0	a	While Boehner cast that as a significant concession, Obama said it didn't go far enough because it didn't include an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent.	0

66nyt29	0	a	The Treasury ruling is one of many that are starting to emerge from all corners of the federal government as Washington changes regulations to conform with the Supreme Court decision.	0

66hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced Thursday that when it comes to taxes, it will recognize same-sex couples' marriages even if they live in a state that does not.	0
66nyt35	0	a	But the Social Security Administration is now using a “place of residence” standard in determining spousal benefits, and a gay couple in Alabama might not receive the same benefits as a gay couple in New York until final determinations are made or Congress acts.	0
66nyt30	0	a	Separately, the Health and Human Services Department said Thursday that Medicare would extend certain key benefits to same-sex spouses, “clarifying that all beneficiaries in private Medicare plans have access to equal coverage when it comes to care in a nursing home where their spouse lives.”	0

1fox9	0	a	Trump on Tuesday specifically cited Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement.	0
1nyt8	0	a	Mr. Trump was facing a potentially awkward task: moderating a debate that only two candidates said they would attend.	0
1nyt7	0	a	“I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!” he said.	0
1hpo5	0	a	The announcement came just eleven days after Trump initially said he was partnering with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates.	0
1hpo3	0	a	"Trump said that he was ending the debate because he did not want to ""give up my right to run as an independent candidate,"" which he claimed the Republican Party was asking him to do if he wanted to moderate the debate."	0
1hpo8	0	a	As the days went on, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling the debate; however, as late as Monday night, he was still saying that the forum was taking place.	0
1hpo1	0	a	"""I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate,"" Trump said in a statement."	0
1fox2	0	a	He cast his decision as a way to keep his options open.	0
1fox0	1	a	Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is bowing out as the moderator for a Republican presidential debate later this month, after most candidates in the field opted not to attend.	1
1hpo7	1	a	Trump also attracted the usual share of public ridicule for his decision to moderate, as well as his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate.	1
1fox8	0	a	Some expressed concern that Trump, who previously flirted with a possible Republican presidential bid before shelving the idea, would not definitively rule out running as a third-party candidate.	0
1fox15	0	a	"""Therefore, so that there is no conflict of interest within the Republican Party, I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate."	0
1fox3	0	a	He said later on Fox News that he's still considering an independent bid.	0

1fox12	0	a	"We would have gotten great ratings,"" Trump said, voicing his trademark confidence."	0
1fox13	0	a	Trump first announced his debate decision in a written statement Tuesday afternoon.	0
1nyt2	0	a	Mr. Trump’s statement on Tuesday that he was bowing out of the Newsmax debate seemed certain to open the door to another round of “I just might …” threats from the real estate mogul.	0
1hpo4	0	a	(Trump made waves by very loudly claiming he was considering running as a Republican earlier in the year.)	0
1fox17	0	a	"Trump went on to praise Gingrich and Santorum for ""having the courage, conviction, and confidence"" to agree to the debate."	0
1fox7	0	a	While former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum agreed to attend early on, other Republican candidates subsequently bowed out.	0
1fox6	0	a	Though the Dec. 27 debate technically is sponsored by Newsmax, Trump quickly became the face of it after he was named as moderator.	0
1fox1	0	a	"Trump said he wanted to make sure there's no ""conflict of interest"" in case he decides to run as a third-party candidate next year."	0
1nyt3	0	a	“It is very important to me that the right Republican candidate be chosen to defeat the failed and very destructive Obama administration,” Mr. Trump said in his statement.	0

1hpo0	0	a	Donald Trump has announced Tuesday that he is pulling out of his own Dec. 27th debate.	0
1nyt6	1	a	Rather than go ahead with the debate and declare that he will not run — Mr. Trump has flirted with running for president several times since the 1980s but has always decided not to follow through — he chose to drop the debate.	1
1nyt11	0	a	Mr. Trump issued the following exclamation-point laden statement through his lawyer, Michael Cohen.	0
1hpo6	0	a	Since then, a majority of those candidates made clear that they would not be turning up, with only Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum pledging to appear.	0
10fox10	0	a	"""Given the struggle of African Americans, given the struggle of women, given the struggle of others to create a more perfect document, to hear that those elements of the Constitution that have been dedacted (sic) by amendment are no less serious, no less part of our ongoing struggle to improve the country and our desire to continue to improve the Constitution, many of us don't want that to be lost upon the reading of our sacred document,"" he said."	0
10fox12	0	a	"""I think it would be helpful to the members if you would explain to us how the determinations of what to read has been made or not made so that we all be on the same page as to congressional intent,"" he said to Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who presided over the reading."	0
10fox2	0	a	Newly sworn members of the House reading aloud the country's founding document on Thursday didn't recite every verse and article of the document because Republicans decided that the obsolete parts can be skipped since they've been superseded by amendment.	0
10hpo10	0	a	“Beyond its symbolic power, however, it is unclear what impact the new rule will have upon the nation.	0
10hpo17	1	a	When one chamber of Congress is in session but not working, we the people still have to pay for members’ salaries and expenses, and for their police protection, and for keeping their lights and phones and coffee machines on.”	1

10nyt16	0	a	“We have spread the word to everyone, and there was a lot of interest,” he said.	0
10nyt13	0	a	But it was also clearly meant as a nod to the Tea Party, a loosely organized political movement whose members cite the Constitution as the basis for much of their political theory concerning federal powers and the rights and responsibilities of Congress.	0
10hpo3	0	a	The House GOP will reportedly make it a requirement that all new bills put forth in the legislative body include “a statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.”	0
10fox5	0	a	Republicans also left out the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person.	0
10fox1	0	a	Turned out it wasn't.	0

10fox9	0	a	"""This is very emotional for me,"" Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., said on the floor before the reading began."	0
10hpo2	0	a	Republicans have made strict adherence to the Constitution a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government.	0
10nyt2	0	a	Before the reading began, Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, asked Republicans to illuminate exactly what part of the Constitution would be read, what parts would be deleted and who would decide how things would unfold.	0

10hpo7	0	a	After handing out pocket-size Constitutions at rallies, after studying the document article by article and after demanding that Washington return to its founding principles, tea party activists have something new to applaud.	0
10nyt6	0	a	From there, members who wished to read were recognized from their seats, beginning with Representative Steve Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey.	0
10hpo21	0	a	Also on Thursday, the House is to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices.	0
10nyt3	0	a	It was decided in advance that any portion of the Constitution that was superseded by amendments — including the amendments themselves — would not be read, preventing lawmakers from having to make references to slaves, referred to in Article 1, Section 2 as “three fifths of all other persons,” or to things like prohibition.	0
10fox4	0	a	However, they did read the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition in 1933 and is still in force.	0
10nyt1	0	a	Like the Constitutional Convention itself, things did not begin auspiciously.	0
10hpo20	1	a	“These new rules show that Republicans are serious about respecting the Constitution.”	1
10hpo6	0	a	These are two standout changes on a long list of new rules Republicans will institute in the House when they assume the majority on Jan. 5.	0
10hpo11	1	a	Under axiomatic legal precedent, virtually all congressional action is presumed valid anyway, at least initially.	1
10hpo1	0	a	Those wondering whether the reading would be dramatic found out on Thursday as volunteers gave voice to the seven articles and 27 amendments that make up the nation’s governing document.	0
10fox27	0	a	"I think it's a valuable exercise and an important moment in this Congress for us to read the Constitution,"" said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y."	0
10nyt7	0	a	And so, sentence by sentence, in accents that reflect the myriad districts that did not even exist when the document came into being, by women and African Americans whose full rights were not recognized at that time, the constitutional language fluttered through the chamber.	0
10hpo13	1	a	It is also quite obvious, from 223 years of legal and political debate on the topic, that the text of the Constitution itself, including those portions that deal with legislative power, is susceptible to many different (and often evolving) views and interpretations, a practical reality that would likely render most “Constitutional Authority Statements” controversial and contentious.”	1
10hpo22	0	a	Republicans have estimated that this will save $35 million over the next nine months.	0
10fox35	0	a	"If that were so, it would never have been ratified in the first place,"" he said."	0
10fox11	0	a	Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., commented that the original document has been changed through amendment, leaving the the reader to interpret the operative language.	0
10hpo8	0	a	A pillar of their grass-roots movement will become a staple in the bureaucracy that governs Congress.”	0
10nyt15	0	a	The order of reading was ironed out at the last minute, with the goal of letting all who wished to read do so, but making sure there was party parity, Mr. Goodlatte said.	0
10fox19	1	a	"Nadler derided what he called the ""ritualistic reading"" as ""total nonsense"" and ""propaganda"" intended to give Republicans claim to the document."	1
10fox24	0	a	"""I think that this is a very symbolic showing to the American people and reminder to the members of congress that we are a government of laws not of men and that this Constitution is the foundation for all of our laws,"" Goodlatte said."	0
10fox25	0	a	And backers said that it wouldn't hurt to try to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers.	0
10fox6	0	a	Portions of the U.S. Constitution are never deleted, just amended, as has been done 27 times in history.	0
10fox0	1	a	Even for a Congress known to battle over every little detail, reading the U.S. Constitution aloud sounded like a simple exercise.	1
10fox33	0	a	Pilon added that the Founders never intended for the Constitution to be viewed as fluid advice.	0
10nyt14	0	a	To wit, the document reading happened on the same day that House Republicans began the contentious process of repealing the health care law, which they have long said lacks constitutional basis.	0
10hpo12	0	a	Moreover, by taking their oaths of office, lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution, and virtually all legislation is vetted for constitutional support on some level by government lawyers before it makes it to committee or to the floor of the House.	0
10nyt17	0	a	According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, the only two prior instances in which a full or partial text of the Constitution was inserted into the Congressional Record was in 1882, when Roswell Flower of New York “appended” a text of the Constitution — minus the amendments — into the record, and in 1915, when Thomas Reilly of Connecticut inserted the full text of the Constitution into the Congressional Record as an extension of his remarks.	0
10hpo18	0	a	“We always hear members of Congress talking about swearing an oath to represent their constituents, when in reality the only oath we take is to the Constitution,” explained newly-minted Speaker John Boehner to the Post.	0
10fox8	0	a	And that was the point of contention for Democratic lawmakers who complained that exempting parts of the document from the reading undermines the objective of the exercise.	0
10hpo15	0	a	“The amount I get is nearly $1.1 million.	0
10nyt11	0	a	“Throughout the last year there has been a great debate about the expansion of the federal government, and lots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution,” said Mr. Goodlatte, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over constitutional amendments.	0
10nyt12	0	a	He added: “I think it is important that we send a message to people at home that the constitution is an important document.”	0
10fox7	0	a	But all the original decisions remain in the Constitution, including in the copies authorized by Congress' Joint Committee on Printing and used in Thursday's reading.	0
10hpo9	0	a	Politics Daily recently reported:	0
10fox16	0	a	"""We fail to show the American people that imperfection is not to be feared and that our ability to constantly improve on what the Founders gave us is a blessing, not a reason for divisiveness."""	0
10fox31	0	a	"""Today the Congress regulates our lives and redistributes our wealth in ways that would shock the Founders,"" he said."	0
10fox17	0	a	Other lawmakers decried the exercise altogether, saying the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter.	0
10nyt0	0	a	Setting the tone for the 112th Congress — in which every House bill must cite the constitutional source of its authority — members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber’s floor on Thursday morning.	0
10fox13	0	a	"Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the reading of the ""amended"" Constitution."	0
10hpo5	0	a	“Call it the tea party-ization of Congress. ...	0
10hpo14	1	a	According to Peter Keating at Vanity Fair, $1.1 million is the estimated cost of GOP plans to read the document on the House floor. 	1
10fox29	1	a	"Historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia University told Fox News the reading may be ""a bit of theater,"" but it is ""not insignificant given that many Republicans have decided -- implausibly, in my opinion -- that the Constitution is the vehicle that can reduce the size of government."""	1
10nyt18	0	a	But the office could not find any examples of the full text of the Constitution actually being read out loud on the House Floor.	0
10fox26	0	a	"""I don't think the Constitution is propaganda."	0
10hpo4	0	a	The Washington Post reported last week that reading the founding document in full appears to be a first in the chamber’s 221-year history:	0
10nyt10	0	a	Largely, it was meant to instruct members, who now must use it to underlie their bills, and to inform voters.	0
10nyt9	0	a	The reading of the document on the floor of the House, an act that is part of the new rules package, serves several purposes, said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who came up with the idea for the live reading.	0
10nyt5	0	a	Once that was settled, just after 11 a.m., Representative John A. Boehner, the newly installed speaker of the House, read the preamble (that magical “We the people”), before yielding to the woman who handed him the gavel on Wednesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1 (“All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives”), followed by Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other House leaders.	0
10nyt8	1	a	At one point, there was yelling in the chamber, and the sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester.	1
10fox23	1	a	But for all those who described the exercise as political waste -- including Vanity Fair magazine, which estimated it as costing more than $1 million -- supporters noted that it was an historic moment -- the first time the U.S. Constitution had been read on the U.S. House floor.	1
10fox37	0	a	"""John Boehner and his cronies are holding up the U.S. Constitution as a sacred, perfect document."	0

10fox34	0	a	"""When liberals tell today that the Constitution is essentially a blank slate to be filled by transient majorities, nothing could be further from the truth."	0
10nyt4	1	a	These inquiries about parliamentary procedure were not well received, and for several minutes, before a word of the preamble could be uttered, Democrats and Republicans battled back and forth over the issue of language, perhaps presaging future partisan battles over the meaning, purpose and application of the document.	1
10fox3	0	a	For instance, lawmakers did not read the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition on liquor in 1919.	0

54hpo0	1	a	WASHINGTON—Joining a chorus of Catholic bishops , theologians, priests, and social justice leaders, nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) to task for his misuse of Catholic social teaching in defending his budget, which hurts the poor.	1
54hpo7	0	a	The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which wrote several letters to Congress saying “a just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons.”	0
54fox11	0	a	Georgetown's Public Policy Institute, which is hosting the upcoming Ryan lecture, said Wednesday the event is still scheduled for Thursday morning.	0
54fox1	0	a	A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., has sent Ryan, R-Wis., a letter saying he’s misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing, GOP House budget.	0

54hpo11	1	a	“Survival of the fittest may be okay for Social Darwinists but not for followers of the gospel of compassion and love.”	1
54fox8	0	a	The writers acknowledge that the teaching indeed calls for local-level solutions to problems but say it is “not a free pass to dismantle government” and requires higher levels of government.	0

54fox6	0	a	"""To me, the principle of subsidiarity, which is really federalism, meaning government closest to the people governs best,"" he said."	0
54fox7	1	a	The Georgetown University letter argues, though, that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching as a “rationale for gutting government programs.”	1
54nyt0	0	a	Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been excoriated by some Roman Catholic leaders ever since he claimed this month that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, was inspired by the moral teachings of his Catholic faith.	0
54fox5	0	a	"In that interview, he invoked the Catholic teaching of ""subsidiarity,"" saying it means ""not having big government crowd out civic society, but ... having enough space in our communities so that we can interact with each other"" and take care of people."	0

54hpo5	0	a	As scholars, we want to join the Catholic bishops in pointing out that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor.”	0
54nyt10	0	a	The budget authored by Mr. Ryan, a rising star among conservatives, has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to distance the church from the Republican Party.	0
54hpo14	0	a	The scholars corrected Mr. Ryan on his use of the Catholic concept of “subsidiarity” as “a rationale gutting government programs.”	0
54fox12	0	a	"""Chairman Ryan remains grateful for Georgetown's invitation to advance a thoughtful dialogue this week on his efforts to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst,” a Ryan spokesman said."	0
54nyt3	1	a	The letter says, “We would be remiss in our duty to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.”	1
54hpo4	1	a	“This is nonsense.	1

19hpo15	0	a	Since then, much intrigue has surrounded what conversations actually took place.	0
19hpo11	0	a	Administration officials had spent time and capital recruiting Senator Arlen Specter to switch parties and run for re-election as a Democrat.	0
19nyt30	1	a	Democrats and some Republicans have said it is hardly unusual for presidents to offer political appointments to clear the way for allies.	1
19nyt10	1	a	“It is abundantly clear that this kind of conduct is contrary to President Obama’s pledge to change ’business as usual’ and that his administration has engaged in the kind of political shenanigans he once campaigned to end.”	1
19nyt31	0	a	But Republicans have suggested such actions may constitute a crime.	0
19nyt3	0	a	The White House disputed Republican claims that the conversations might be illegal or improper.	0
19nyt14	0	a	The White House did not offer Mr. Sestak a full-time paid position because Mr. Emanuel wanted him to stay in the House rather than risk losing his seat, so he considered “uncompensated advisory board options.”	0
19hpo3	0	a	It would have allowed Sestak to remain in the House of Representatives while advising the president.	0
19fox8	0	a	Sestak was also a loyal and tireless supporter of Hillary Clinton's run for the presidency in 2008.	0
19hpo24	0	a	The source insisted that no laws were broken in the process of offering the position, that the matter hardly rose to the level of political scandal -- suggesting that Republicans on the Hill were hoping to reap political benefits from the saga.	0
19fox3	0	a	One of the jobs Clinton specifically discussed with Sestak was the president's intelligence advisory board.	0
19nyt34	0	a	Government officials, who asked not to be identified discussing legal decisions, said that neither the Justice Department nor the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that looks at violations of the Hatch Act governing the political conduct of federal employees, is investigating.	0
19fox19	0	a	"""This is about the White House."	0
19nyt35	0	a	While declining to discuss what happened, Mr. Obama on Thursday said, “I can assure the public that nothing improper took place.”	0

19fox18	1	a	"This is a felony,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who has been leading the charge for more details on the allegation."	1

19hpo21	0	a	The investigation was internal at first with the White House reaching conclusions at least two-and-a-half months ago.	0
19nyt17	0	a	In a statement Friday, Mr. Sestak said Mr. Clinton had conveyed Mr. Emanuel’s suggestion that he join a “presidential board” while remaining in the House, but he declined.	0
19fox2	0	a	Batting down allegations that the White House dangled the secretary of Navy position in front of Sestak, the report said that Sestak was offered executive branch positions on advisory boards that were uncompensated.	0
19nyt2	0	a	Mr. Sestak said no and went on to win last week’s primary against Senator Arlen Specter.	0
19nyt23	0	a	In tapping Mr. Clinton as the go-between, Mr. Emanuel picked the party’s most prominent figure other than Mr. Obama and someone Mr. Sestak had worked for on the National Security Council in the 1990s.	0
19fox12	0	a	"The White House report disputed any suggestion that there was ""impropriety"" in Clinton's discussion with Sestak over possible alternatives to his Senate candidacy."	0
19fox4	0	a	But a White House official said the plan always was for Sestak to remain in the House, and he couldn't have served in the House and on the president's intelligence advisory board.	0
19nyt26	0	a	As chief of staff and previously as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Emanuel has not been shy about trying to steer party nominations to those he considers the stronger candidates.	0
19hpo7	0	a	The account offered by the source was the most detailed to date from primary sources as to the conversations they had with Sestak regarding his entrance into the Pennsylvania race.	0
19hpo18	0	a	The White House, when pressed on the matter, had been vague.	0
19hpo13	0	a	When Sestak began making overtures that he would run, the White House looked for ways to follow through on its promise.	0

80fox0	0	a	A pending class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart that would be the largest of its kind in U.S. history may soon be dismissed, considering the tenor of oral arguments before the Supreme Court Tuesday.	0
80hpo18	0	a	Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer by bringing discrimination claims, said it was possible that Wal-Mart could refute the claims at a trial.	0
80hpo11	0	a	He said Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture stereotypes women as less aggressive than men and that translates into individual pay and promotion decisions at the more than 4,300 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores across the country.	0
80nyt6	0	a	It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court’s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.	0
80fox19	0	a	But they are not big enough where they can't be challenged in a court of law.	0
80nyt9	0	a	The plaintiffs’ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes.	0
80fox30	0	a	"But those two remedies require different standards for class certification and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it was ""a very serious problem"" in the case to try and sue for punitive damages after only obtaining certification under the lower threshold required for the injunction."	0
80fox25	0	a	Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued that every member of the class couldn't possibly meet a standard of commonality to justify the lawsuit.	0
80hpo20	0	a	But several of their more conservative colleagues appeared to agree with Theodore Boutrous Jr., representing Wal-Mart, that even subjecting the company to a trial would be unfair.	0
80hpo12	0	a	"""The decisions are informed by the values the company provides,"" Sellers said."	0
80hpo4	0	a	In Tuesday's arguments, several justices suggested they were troubled by the case and lower court decisions against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart.	0

80fox6	0	a	It also claims that despite a company policy expressly prohibiting discrimination, local store managers are given too much flexibility in determining salary hikes and job promotions that invariably favor men over women.	0
80hpo16	0	a	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that at this stage of the lawsuit, the issue is not proving discrimination but showing enough evidence to go forward.	0
80fox28	0	a	Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking.	0
80fox17	0	a	On Tuesday, Dukes walked out of the courthouse full of confidence and poise saying she feels no anger toward her bosses or anyone else.	0
80nyt31	0	a	“What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?” Justice Ginsburg asked.	0
80hpo14	0	a	"""Well, which is it?"" Scalia asked."	0
80nyt32	0	a	Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions.	0
80nyt41	0	a	It doesn’t comport with due process.	0
80nyt38	0	a	“The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,” Mr. Boutrous said.	0
80nyt2	0	a	Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.	0
80nyt8	0	a	For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.	0
80fox7	0	a	This dual argument that confounded Justice Kennedy also drew the ire of Justice Antonin Scalia who said he was whipsawed by the claims.	0
80fox3	0	a	"""Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on,"" Kennedy told lawyer Joseph Sellers who represents the women."	0
80nyt12	0	a	The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity.	0
80hpo17	0	a	"""We're talking about getting a foot in the door,"" Ginsburg said, a standard she called not hard to meet."	0
80hpo5	0	a	Estimates of how many women could be included in the lawsuit run from 500,000 to 1.6 million.	0
80hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers.	0
80nyt7	0	a	The issue before the justices at Tuesday’s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there.	0
80fox23	1	a	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and major corporations including Bank of America, General Electric and Microsoft submitted briefs in the case supporting Wal-Mart.	1

80nyt33	0	a	Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.	0

80nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart.	0
80nyt51	0	a	“Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII” of the Civil Rights Act?	0
80nyt17	0	a	“Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?” Justice Breyer asked.	0
80hpo10	0	a	Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit.	0
80fox8	0	a	"""If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion,"" he said."	0
80fox12	0	a	The case started a decade ago when Wal-Mart worker Betty Dukes said the management at her Pittsburg, Calif., store was bypassing her for promotions.	0
80nyt19	0	a	And Justice Elena Kagan said that “excessive subjectivity” may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.	0
80nyt16	0	a	But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores.	0
80hpo25	0	a	Two of the named plaintiffs, Christine Kwapnoski and Betty Dukes, attended the argument.	0
80nyt47	0	a	After all, he said, “you’re going to have some bad apples” given Wal-Mart’s thousands of stores.	0
80nyt44	0	a	Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. “The comparison that’s relevant,” he said, “is between men and women and Wal-Mart.”	0
80hpo6	0	a	Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a key vote on the high court, said the women's argument points in apparently conflicting directions.	0
80hpo2	0	a	Billions of dollars are at stake if it is allowed to go forward.	0
80nyt52	0	a	“That could very well be the case,” Mr. Sellers said.	0
80nyt26	0	a	Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.	0
80hpo32	0	a	David Sanford, who represents plaintiffs in other class-action cases, said after the arguments that the court seemed inclined to rule against the Wal-Mart women.	0
80hpo33	1	a	"Sanford said such a decision could ""have implications for class actions more generally, making it more difficult for women and minority groups to enjoy equality and fair treatment in the workplace."""	1
80fox29	0	a	In addition to the punitive damages they want an injunction that would force Wal-Mart to adopt more stringent anti-discrimination policies.	0
80nyt3	0	a	The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.	0
80fox13	1	a	"""I could see the men going forth and the women in the store stayed in the basic positions they were always in,"" Dukes once told an interviewer."	1
80hpo15	0	a	"Either individual managers are on their own, ""or else a strong corporate culture tells them what to do."""	0
80hpo34	0	a	The Obama administration is not taking part in the case, although it was lobbied by both sides.	0

28hpo26	1	a	A series of explosive reports over the last week have heightened the appearance that Trump interfered with the investigation.	1
28nyt26	0	a	If Mr. Trump picks Mr. Lieberman, one adviser said he might serve for a short stint — to lend his bipartisan reputation to a president badly in needed of credibility — instead of the full term.	0

28hpo10	0	a	“There is no reason to appoint a politician to run the FBI,” Schatz said.	0

28nyt1	1	a	But members of Mr. Trump’s staff — alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience — have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire.	1

28nyt23	0	a	The White House remains divided, and several senior officials expressed serious doubts about Mr. Lieberman.	0
28nyt11	1	a	It was unclear whether the president’s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the “Apprentice”-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate.	1
28hpo16	1	a	A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: “There couldn’t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician.	1

28hpo24	0	a	“Joe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Democrat colleagues combined, so screw them,” McCain said of Democrats’ concerns.	0
28hpo12	0	a	And more to the point, it is not as if there is no one else qualified to do this job.	0
28nyt6	0	a	Still, Mr. Trump, speaking briefly with reporters in the Oval Office as he met with President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, offered an emphatic “yes” when asked whether Mr. Lieberman was among the finalists.	0
28nyt14	0	a	Mr. McCabe, a veteran agent who joined the bureau in 1996 and once specialized in Russian organized crime, was named deputy director in 2016.	0

28fox2	0	a	A late and somewhat unlikely addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman is nonetheless the sudden frontrunner.	0
28hpo14	0	a	It is rare for an FBI director to be appointed without the full backing of the Senate, Schatz noted.	0
28nyt18	0	a	He is also friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator, who has told Trump aides that Mr. Lieberman would most likely receive overwhelming support in the Senate.	0

67fox0	0	a	"The AARP pushed back Friday on a report claiming the nation's most powerful seniors lobby was dropping its opposition to benefits cuts -- but at the same time acknowledged ""benefit adjustments"" would be necessary to make the system solvent."	0
67hpo31	0	a	The base also effectively serves as a cap on benefits because they are calculated according to a worker's contributions over his or her lifetime.	0
67fox20	0	a	But the president's budget director told Fox News that even when the trust funds run out, both Social Security and Medicare would still have some income.	0
67hpo2	0	a	AARP initially pushed back against the newspaper's story.	0
67fox7	0	a	While the AARP claims its position on strengthening Social Security remains unchanged, others outside the organization detected a shift.	0
67hpo30	0	a	Social Security's retirement benefits are funded with taxes on incomes up to $106,800, known as the taxable earnings base.	0
67nyt18	1	a	The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program’s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.	1
67nyt3	0	a	Mr. Rother said the group’s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Friday’s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole.	0
67hpo20	0	a	"The official said that he and other opponents of benefit cuts had been told that AARP's ""longstanding position"" hadn't changed, but there was some uncertainty about what that position actually is."	0
67nyt22	0	a	While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group’s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.	0
67fox19	1	a	Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund last week warned the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2036 and under current law, seniors would then face a 23 percent across-the-board cut in benefits.	1
67hpo6	0	a	"""Everybody knows we need to look at a package of different changes to Social Security to make it strong for the long term,"" he said."	0
67hpo23	0	a	After 2036, the program will only be able to pay 77 percent of promised benefits.	0
67fox4	0	a	He said AARP remains opposed to cutting Social Security for the sake of deficit reduction and to any privatization plan.	0
67hpo17	0	a	"""The AARP has a history of division between the top folks and their base on these issues."	0
67fox12	0	a	Her office claims the bill would cut deficits by $416 billion over the next decade and keep Social Security solvent by instead raising the retirement age to 69 over 16 years and cutting yearly cost-of-living adjustments by 1 percent.	0
67fox5	0	a	"""We are currently fighting proposals to cut Social Security to pay the nation's bills,"" he said."	0
67hpo15	0	a	"Now that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it."""	0
67fox6	0	a	"However, AARP legislative policy director David Certner told Fox News that Social Security needs a ""package of revenue and benefit adjustments ... to make it solvent."""	0
67fox15	0	a	But the AARP has told Fox News that Hutchison's proposal is not acceptable.	0
67hpo26	1	a	Economists credit the program for drastically reducing poverty among the elderly since its creation in the 1930s.	1
67hpo37	1	a	That proposal went nowhere.	1
67fox2	0	a	The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that the AARP, which opposed President George W. Bush's push to partially privatize Social Security, has decided to accept cuts -- though it would reportedly push for tax hikes to close most of the long-term Social Security shortfall.	0
67nyt9	0	a	But other advocacy groups that are pushing to preserve Social Security benefits accused AARP of effectively abandoning its core constituency.	0
67hpo18	0	a	"The top folks like to be in the inside game,"" one union official said."	0
67hpo24	0	a	By 2085, it will be able to pay 74 percent of promised benefits.	0
67hpo14	0	a	"""For decades, AARP has stood against any substantial changes to Social Security."	0
67hpo10	0	a	"He suggested raising the age at which retirees can receive full benefits -- currently, 66 years old -- would be on the table even though doing so represents ""a massive benefit cut for people."""	0
67hpo19	1	a	"""But they are walking backwards now."""	1
67nyt25	1	a	While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security “to determine how each might — individually or in different combinations — impact the lives of current and future retirees.”	1
67hpo29	0	a	Rother's thinking, according to the paper, is that tax increases alone can't keep the program's $2.6 trillion trust fund from running out of money, so benefit cuts must be included as well.	0
67hpo9	0	a	"And we're certainly willing to talk about a package of changes that will keep Social Security strong."""	0
67nyt12	0	a	But Mr. Richtman said the group’s openness to considering future cuts would no doubt be used by deficit hawks to push for immediate cuts in Social Security benefits as part of the debate over deficit reduction.	0
67fox9	1	a	"""AARP's new and welcome position is a positive step towards the type of reforms I've championed, and I look forward to working with the organization to shape the changes in a way that makes the least detrimental impact to present and future retirees,"" she said in a statement."	1
22nyt5	0	a	“And if we don’t get it, there should be no deal,” she added.	0
22nyt6	0	a	Mrs. Clinton indicated that if she were president, she would not abandon the 12-nation Pacific trade deal – as some Democrats want – but would use the opposition in Congress as negotiating leverage.	0
22nyt22	0	a	“I have held my peace because I thought it was important for the Congress to have a full debate without thrusting presidential politics and candidates into it,” Mrs. Clinton added.	0
22nyt1	0	a	In her first detailed comments on the trade deal since the House of Representatives refused on Friday to allow Mr. Obama to negotiate it freely, Mrs. Clinton laid out a far more calibrated position on the deal than many Democrats and Republicans have taken.	0

22nyt7	0	a	“I am willing to try now to see whether you can push to get rid of the objectionable parts, to drive a harder bargain on some of the other parts,” Mrs. Clinton said at the rally, her first here as a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination.	0

22fox13	1	a	Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, has opposed the trade deal and questioned Clinton's refusal to say where she stood.	1
22nyt19	0	a	Later on Sunday, at a house party with Democrats in Burlington, Iowa, Mrs. Clinton was more explicit in challenging Mr. Obama by setting expectations for him to work with congressional Democrats on the trade deal.	0
22fox4	0	a	Courting Iowa voters, Clinton sought to address Democratic opponents of the trade legislation, including liberals and labor unions, who have said the Obama-backed plan will cost U.S. jobs.	0
22fox8	0	a	The White House and Republican leaders in Congress now face long odds in trying to revive the trade legislation after congressional Democrats helped defeat a job retraining program to jeopardize Obama's attempt to secure the fast-track authority.	0
22hpo7	0	a	"""Here's what I think should happen now,"" Clinton said."	0
22fox14	0	a	"""It is a failed trade policy, and I would hope that the Secretary joins Elizabeth Warren, and vast majority of Democrats in the Congress in saying, ‘No, we've got to defeat this piece of legislation,’ ” Sanders said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."""	0

22fox18	1	a	Republican leaders generally support Obama's trade proposal and have suggested they may try to revive the bill as early as this week.	1
22nyt2	1	a	She declined to take sides on the Friday vote itself but instead allied herself with Democratic critics of the deal — without actually opposing it.	1
22nyt0	0	a	DES MOINES – Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday urged President Obama to listen to congressional Democrats – particular the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi – and make changes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that reflect their concerns about protecting American jobs and wages.	0
22fox15	0	a	Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has also opposed the deal.	0
22nyt13	0	a	“No president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers with either our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill than I would be,” Mrs. Clinton said.	0
22nyt9	0	a	She is facing many Democratic primary voters who have deep misgivings about trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, that President Bill Clinton signed, and she faces rivals for the 2016 nomination like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who flatly oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership.	0
22nyt14	0	a	“There are the voices that are for the deal no matter what’s in it, and there are voices that are against the deal no matter what’s in it.	0

22fox20	0	a	"""The question is: Are the Democrats going to do this to their president?"""	0
22nyt21	0	a	“My view is the White House should call Nancy and a few other of the Democrats to say, ‘What would it take to get an agreement that would be better and not worse for American workers?’” Mrs. Clinton said, aligning herself with a potential future ally (Ms. Pelosi) over a lame-duck president.	0
22fox5	0	a	The agreement has not been finalized or submitted to Congress.	0

22fox21	1	a	"While Clinton called the pact the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements while serving as secretary of state, she has refused to take a position on the deal since announcing her candidacy."	1

98hpo1	0	a	Advocates are hoping for a plan that would give undocumented immigrants a chance to both remain in the country and eventually become citizens, but House Republicans have indicated that the latter is something most cannot support.	0
98nyt2	0	a	The document is expected to call for border security and enforcement measures, as well as providing a path to legal status — but not citizenship — for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, the aides said.	0
98hpo5	0	a	"There won't be amnesty inside it."""	0
98fox7	0	a	The path to legalization’s inclusion in the plan – which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.	0
98fox11	0	a	Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes.	0
98nyt7	0	a	But the legislation stalled in the Republican-controlled House, where some of the party’s more conservative members oppose any form of legal status as “amnesty.”	0
98fox1	0	a	Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, who is the third-ranking Republican in the House, made his comments in an interview with KBFX-TV in Bakersfield, Calif. just as his fellow GOP lawmakers are expected to unveil any day a set of “immigration principles” that reportedly call for a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants.	0
98nyt12	0	a	Representative Peter T. King, a Republican of New York and a longtime critic of proposals to change the immigration system, said it was significant that both the third-ranking Republican in the House, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, and the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, had voiced support in recent days for legal status for some immigrants living in the country illegally — and have taken very little heat for their remarks on either side of the aisle.	0
98nyt19	0	a	Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, one of the Democratic architects of the Senate bill, said: “One thing is certain, just as with the budget, at some point both the House and the Senate will have to sit down and resolve all the contentious issues.”	0
98fox13	0	a	The plan commits itself to the idea – which is heavily favored by many Republicans – that immigration reform will be handled in a piecemeal fashion, instead of comprehensively, as the Senate did.	0
98nyt9	0	a	The White House has said it wants a path to citizenship for both children and adults in any new immigration legislation.	0
98hpo7	0	a	McCarthy has previously been more open to immigration reform than many of his House Republican colleagues, and, as TPM notes, his district is 35 percent Latino.	0

98nyt16	0	a	“It’s not worth having a party divided when we have so many issues we can come together on.”	0
98nyt5	0	a	But, he added, “if we can make some compromises here for the good of the country, I think we have a very good chance for the first time in a long time of changing something that is really damaging all of us.”	0
98fox14	0	a	Obama told Senate Democrats this week that he believes that Boehner will make sure immigration reform is passed this year, according to The Hill, a a political publication in Washington, D.C.	0
98fox9	0	a	They maintain that that giving those immigrants any kind of break would amount to amnesty, or rewarding law-breakers.	0
98fox15	0	a	The president reportedly told the Democrats in a meeting that Republicans need to take action on immigration in order to keep the volatile issue from hurting their chances with Latino voters, as it appears to have done in 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did extremely poorly with the increasingly important voting bloc.	0
98fox3	0	a	“But if you want to become a citizen, you’ll have to go through the path.	0
98fox8	0	a	Conservative members of the Republicans in the House, where they hold a majority, had been adamant about not signing off on any measure that called for granting a pathway to legalization for people who are living in the country illegally.	0

98nyt11	0	a	“But legalization with no path to citizenship can gain some votes.”	0
98nyt18	0	a	Critics worry that House Republican leaders and Senate Democrats are essentially negotiating a final deal, bypassing formal House-Senate negotiations, where conservatives had hoped to derail the process.	0
98nyt6	0	a	The Senate, led by Democrats, passed a broad bipartisan measure in June to overhaul immigration that included a 13-year path to citizenship.	0
98nyt17	0	a	On Thursday, aides to House conservatives who oppose the leadership’s plan gathered in the office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce opponent of the immigration push, to plot a strategy to torpedo it.	0

98nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — House Republicans are preparing to unveil their own broad template for overhauling the nation’s immigration system this week, potentially offering a small opening for President Obama and congressional Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation before the end of the year.	0
98hpo2	0	a	Although he's expressed openness to legal status previously, his comments could be a hint at what's to come in the House GOP's plan to soon release its own principles for immigration reform.	0
98nyt8	0	a	But heading into the three-day Republican retreat, even some of the most ardent conservatives say consensus is forming around an immigration package that would include several separate bills on border security; a clampdown against the hiring of undocumented workers; expanded guest-worker programs; a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; and a path to legal status for undocumented workers with family ties to citizens or employer sponsors.	0
98nyt4	0	a	“The principles they lay out I’m sure won’t satisfy everybody,” Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, said at an immigration forum on Friday.	0
98nyt3	0	a	The Republican effort comes as Mr. Obama is expected to push once again for an overhaul of the immigration system in his State of the Union address Tuesday, and as lawmakers from both parties describe immigration as one of the few potential areas for bipartisan compromise before the end of the current Congress.	0
98hpo8	0	a	Immigration activists have targeted McCarthy specifically due to his high rank in the House GOP.	0
98fox10	0	a	That created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some – including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida – arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty.	0
98fox6	0	a	The House Republican immigration principles reportedly will cover how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, and how many of the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to various media stories.	0
98nyt1	0	a	Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders are expected to release a one-page statement of immigration principles this week at their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md., according to aides with knowledge of the plan.	0

2nyt66	1	a	For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall.	1

2nyt65	0	a	Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.	0
2hpo7	0	a	To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.	0

2hpo11	1	a	Since 2014, a high proportion of those crossing have been Central American children and families seeking to make humanitarian claims such as asylum.	1
2hpo20	0	a	Congress passed a government funding bill Thursday evening.	0
2nyt9	1	a	Mr. Trump’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.	1
2hpo3	1	a	“I could do the wall over a longer period of time ― I didn’t need to do this,” Trump said in a televised speech, even as he contended the situation on the southern border amounted to a national emergency.	1
2nyt20	0	a	“Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him.	0

2fox26	0	a	The president’s decision to declare a national emergency comes after a review of the spending package.	0
2fox33	0	a	From Dec. 22 through Jan. 25—for 35 days—the White House and congressional Democrats battled over border security funding.	0

2fox23	0	a	This is far from the only declared national emergency.	0
2nyt7	0	a	The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move.	0
2nyt52	0	a	Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress.	0
2hpo1	0	a	Trump, who was accompanied by parents of children killed by unauthorized immigrants, said he was declaring the national emergency for “virtual invasion purposes.”	0
2hpo0	0	a	President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border in an effort to unilaterally seize funding to begin building his long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico.	0

2nyt32	0	a	Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.	0
2nyt49	0	a	Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward.	0
2hpo28	0	a	There is no national emergency,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement.	0
2fox5	0	a	"Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that ""walls work"" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation."	0
2hpo2	0	a	But he also acknowledged another reason: He didn’t want to wait on Congress to approve the funds.	0
2nyt4	0	a	But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action.	0

2hpo24	0	a	Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by “unlocking” new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.	0
2hpo34	0	a	In January, Trump asserted that he had “the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” according to CNN.	0
2hpo30	1	a	Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a “gross abuse of the power of the presidency” and vowed that “Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.”	1
2nyt2	0	a	“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought.	0
2nyt30	0	a	The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall.	0
2hpo35	0	a	He called it “the easy route” while insisting that he’d rather Congress approve his border wall funding.	0
2nyt28	0	a	The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it.	0
2fox34	0	a	Trump requested $5.7 billion for construction of the wall, while Democrats vowed to block any spending proposal that included such funding.	0
2nyt22	0	a	Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier.	0
2nyt67	0	a	Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.	0
2nyt63	0	a	The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall.	0
2nyt10	1	a	The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not.	1

2hpo17	0	a	The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed.	0
2fox0	0	a	President Trump said Friday he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he signs a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security.	0
2hpo19	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision.	0
2hpo29	1	a	“If Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won’t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.”	1
2nyt37	0	a	The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land.	0
2nyt43	0	a	But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin.	0
2fox30	0	a	The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier.	0
2nyt33	0	a	The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans.	0
2nyt26	0	a	Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor.	0

2nyt61	0	a	In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year.	0
2fox3	0	a	But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package.	0

6nyt31	1	a	Democratic campaign officials accused Republicans of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks, noting that their outrage over the Islamic center came just weeks after many House Republicans opposed a new medical program to monitor and treat emergency workers and others suffering ill effects from exposure to hazardous materials at ground zero.	1

6nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Republican Congressional candidates on Monday intensified efforts to inject the divide over construction of an Islamic center near ground zero into the midterm campaigns while the Senate’s top Democrat said he objected to the mosque being built there.	0
6nyt23	0	a	Two mosques, founded in 1970 and 1985, are already within several blocks of the proposed center.	0
6fox0	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid broke with President Obama Monday over the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, saying the controversial Islamic center should be built elsewhere.	0
6nyt5	0	a	In a number of releases and statements, Republican House and Senate candidates challenged Democrats like Mr. Reid to make their positions clear on the construction of a mosque and community center about two blocks from the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City.	0
6fox10	0	a	Republicans have since both criticized his position and pressured other Democrats to take a stand on the politically sticky issue, one where charges of insensitivity have flown on both sides.	0
6nyt22	0	a	The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, a real estate investor born in New York, has said the center would include meeting rooms, a prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium and a pool.	0
6hpo8	0	a	If anything, it's clearer now than it was last week (when Democrats were mostly silent on the matter) how deeply the party just wants this entire issue to go away.	0
6nyt26	0	a	That caused other Republicans to warn that the party risked a backlash and was alienating the nation’s Muslims.	0
6hpo4	0	a	"""The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,"" reads a statement from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office (D-Nev.)."	0
6nyt21	0	a	The other two are all but vacant now; worship services are already taking place in one of them.	0
6hpo9	1	a	Reid, after all, only issued the above statement after his Republican opponents began hitting him for going silent on the matter.	1
6nyt2	0	a	That separates Mr. Reid from President Obama’s support of the developers’ right to build the center.	0
6nyt19	1	a	Mr. Nadler, whose view is that the developers were entitled to build the mosque at the selected location if they choose, said, “Ultimately I suspect that once this simmers down in a few weeks, people will realize that everybody’s liberty is at stake here.”	1
6nyt29	0	a	“We would never accept the Japanese putting up a site next to Pearl Harbor.	0
6fox28	0	a	However, the poll showed that 64 percent think it would be wrong to build it, regardless of whether the developers are within their right to do so.	0
6hpo0	0	a	"President Barack Obama's endorsement of the ""Ground Zero mosque"" during a speech on Friday night spurred some hope among supporters that a forceful case could be made for both the project's constitutionality and its larger geopolitical impact."	0
6nyt28	0	a	“Nazis don’t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust Museum in Washington,” Mr. Gingrich said on the Fox News program “Fox and Friends.”	0
6hpo7	0	a	Combined, Obama's clarification and Reid's opposition represent a double dose of bad news for progressives and even Republicans who believed that a strong case could be made in favor of Cordoba House.	0
6fox6	0	a	The president first stepped into the fray Friday when he appeared to endorse the Park 51 project during a Ramadan dinner at the White House.	0
6nyt12	0	a	Some leading Democrats said it was the president’s role to stand up for constitutional rights in the mosque dispute.	0
6nyt17	0	a	Other Democrats said they did not see the fight resonating strongly outside New York and did not expect it to become a defining campaign issue.	0
6fox33	0	a	"And so, in this case, he decided to state clearly how he feels about making sure that people are treated equally, that there is a fairness and that our bedrock principles are upheld,"" Burton said."	0
6fox13	0	a	"""The president didn't do this because of the politics."	0
6nyt1	0	a	Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader and a Democrat facing a difficult re-election fight, said through a spokesman that those who plan to erect the Islamic center should look elsewhere.	0
6nyt8	0	a	Republicans said Mr. Obama’s defense of the right of the developers to pursue the project showed that he was out of touch with average Americans.	0
6nyt4	0	a	“Senator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built someplace else.”	0
6fox30	0	a	They say it would be a mistake to equate Islam as a whole, and its practice in the United States, with Al Qaeda -- and remind critics that Muslims were also killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center.	0
6nyt16	0	a	Some also said the White House should not have put lawmakers on the spot in the first place and could have been better prepared for the president’s statement, lining up religious and community leaders to offer support for the right to build the mosque and undermine Republican attacks.	0
6nyt14	1	a	Privately, many Democrats were not pleased that the issue had been thrown into their laps during the summer recess as they believed they had been making inroads by talking about how some Republicans support privatizing Social Security.	1
6nyt18	0	a	Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who represents the district that includes ground zero, said he doubted that the fight over the mosque would inflict much damage on fellow Democrats in the November elections.	0
6fox3	0	a	"""The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,"" Manley said."	0

6fox31	0	a	Burton said Monday that the president weighed in as part of a constitutional discussion.	0
6nyt27	0	a	But Mr. Gingrich showed no sign of backing down on Monday.	0
6fox8	0	a	"Then White House spokesman Bill Burton said Obama was not ""backing off"" his original remarks."	0

83hpo18	0	a	Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) was the other conservative alternate to McCarthy, though he is almost as much an establishment character as anyone else in leadership.	0
83fox22	0	a	But Labrador famously quit the group because of a disagreement with its other members over whether to entitle undocumented immigrants to some form of healthcare.	0
83nyt20	0	a	Mr. McCarthy spent much of the day calling members and shoring up support, said a Republican aide close to the majority whip.	0
83nyt23	0	a	His decision to jump in was widely seen as proof that more experienced conservative members, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio or Tom Price of Georgia, had rebuffed overtures to run from other conservatives.	0

83hpo3	0	a	McCarthy, 49, began gathering commitments from other House Republicans on Wednesday, the day after then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suffered a stunning loss in the primary for his seat.	0

83hpo23	0	a	Members of the tea party caucus also want to vote for a majority leader candidate that they believe in, even if he loses.	0
83hpo26	0	a	There is always a chance that grassroots fervor in support of Labrador could gain a level of intensity that Boehner and McCarthy did not anticipate.	0
83hpo27	0	a	However, there's not a lot of time for that to happen before next Thursday's election, and leadership elections generally are dominated by inside baseball politics and arcane political interests.	0
83hpo29	1	a	Labrador is an ambitious, sometimes savvy politician.	1
83nyt10	0	a	FreedomWorks, which has provided financial support for Tea Party candidates, immediately began trying to generate support for Mr. Labrador through its websites and email lists.	0
83nyt28	0	a	Born the son of a single mother in Puerto Rico, he has seen himself as an ambassador to young and minority voters out of reach to traditional Republicans.	0

83hpo9	1	a	"But the message from Tuesday is clear -- Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,"" Labrador said in a statement."	1
83nyt9	1	a	House conservatives — lacking a rationale to fight Mr. McCarthy, a well-liked member of leadership who has raised millions of dollars for Republican incumbents — have begun protesting that his voting record is actually to the left of Mr. Cantor’s.	1
83fox24	0	a	The Idaho congressman, echoing other conservatives, has said that Congress should wait until at least 2015 to take up the issue again because President Obama must make a clear attempt to take steps to secure the borders and step up interior enforcement of immigration laws.	0
83fox32	0	a	One of the conservative members in the House who wanted to postpone the June 19 vote for majority leader quickly indicated that for him, Labrador would not do.	0
83fox16	0	a	But some observers said Cantor’s tough stance toward the end of the primary – one he’d seemed confident he’d easily win – was too little too late.	0
83nyt12	0	a	Matt Kibbe, the group’s president and chief executive, said that he did not have great qualms with Mr. McCarthy’s ideology, but that he was more about politics than ideas.	0
83fox19	0	a	The Senate last year passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration reform bill that both tightened border security and provided a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who meet a strict set of criteria.	0

83hpo14	0	a	When Cantor lost his seat in a shock result Tuesday, conservatives in the House were not prepared to unite behind a standard-bearer, much less wage an organized effort to whip up votes in support of a candidate for majority leader.	0
83hpo16	0	a	But Hensarling pondered his options for a full day Wednesday, while McCarthy moved quickly to generate support.	0
83nyt26	0	a	Mr. Labrador tried on Friday to at least engage the Republican conference in a debate over ideas.	0
83hpo12	0	a	Since the 2010 midterm tea party wave election, the House GOP has contained a bloc of members who have opposed the establishment leadership time and time again.	0

83hpo24	0	a	House GOP leadership understands that desire, as does Labrador.	0

83fox3	0	a	Labrador’s foray into the race for majority leader is yet another dramatic turn of events for Republicans, who were stunned by the defeat in Tuesday’s primary in Virginia of Rep.

83hpo21	0	a	The situation left House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the rest of the Republican leadership in the House with a problem: The 40 or so hardline tea party members of the House GOP do not want the response to Cantor's loss -- which was driven by grassroots discontent with the establishment -- to simply be more establishment leadership.	0
83hpo33	0	a	They want someone different.	0

83hpo25	0	a	A Labrador bid helps all parties regardless of the outcome -- including Labrador himself, since a run will elevate him as a leader inside the House GOP.	0
83hpo19	0	a	He too declined to run, sensing McCarthy's near inevitability.	0
83fox28	0	a	Labrador says this about himself on his website: “Born to a single mother in Puerto Rico, Raúl Labrador moved with his mother to the mainland U.S. at age 13.”	0
83fox18	0	a	Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers.	0
83fox26	0	a	Labrador supports a path to legal status, but only after evidence that enforcement has been improved, he has said.	0
