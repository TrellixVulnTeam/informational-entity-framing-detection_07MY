67hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The nation's leading advocate for senior citizens says that it hasn't wavered in its opposition to cutting Social Security benefits, though a top official with the group said it is open to a discussion about raising the retirement age and other changes.	0
67fox10	0	a	There is still plenty of space between the kind of plan Hutchison is calling for and what groups like the AARP would accept.	0
67nyt1	0	a	The group’s stance, which generated quick reaction from all sides because of its powerful voice on the issue, could provide added ammunition to fiscal conservatives who have sought unsuccessfully to restructure Social Security and chip away at the benefits it promises older Americans.	0
67nyt6	0	a	Nonetheless, the group’s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARP’s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including Medicare, prescription drugs and many more.	0
67nyt5	0	a	He made clear that the group’s willingness to discuss cuts comes with conditions: Reductions in benefits should be “minimal,” they should not affect current recipients and instead should be directed “far off in the future,” and they should be offset by increases in tax-generated revenue.	0
67hpo38	0	a	"UPDATE: AARP CEO A. Barry Rand said in a statement, ""It has long been AARP's policy that Social Security should be strengthened to provide adequate benefits and that it is sufficiently financed to ensure solvency with a stable trust fund for the next 75 years."""	0

67hpo12	0	a	Jonathan Cowan, president of centrist think tank Third Way, hailed AARP's apparent reversal, per the Journal story.	0
67nyt7	0	a	Third Way, a moderate Democratic group in Washington that has favored possible reductions in benefits, called AARP’s position “a watershed moment” in the debate over Social Security.	0
67fox0	0	a	"The AARP pushed back Friday on a report claiming the nation's most powerful seniors lobby was dropping its opposition to benefits cuts -- but at the same time acknowledged ""benefit adjustments"" would be necessary to make the system solvent."	0
67hpo31	0	a	The base also effectively serves as a cap on benefits because they are calculated according to a worker's contributions over his or her lifetime.	0
67fox20	0	a	But the president's budget director told Fox News that even when the trust funds run out, both Social Security and Medicare would still have some income.	0
67hpo2	0	a	AARP initially pushed back against the newspaper's story.	0
67fox7	0	a	While the AARP claims its position on strengthening Social Security remains unchanged, others outside the organization detected a shift.	0
67hpo30	0	a	Social Security's retirement benefits are funded with taxes on incomes up to $106,800, known as the taxable earnings base.	0
67nyt18	1	a	The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program’s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.	1
67nyt3	0	a	Mr. Rother said the group’s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Friday’s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole.	0
67hpo20	0	a	"The official said that he and other opponents of benefit cuts had been told that AARP's ""longstanding position"" hadn't changed, but there was some uncertainty about what that position actually is."	0
67nyt22	0	a	While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group’s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.	0
67fox19	1	a	Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund last week warned the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2036 and under current law, seniors would then face a 23 percent across-the-board cut in benefits.	1

67hpo26	1	a	Economists credit the program for drastically reducing poverty among the elderly since its creation in the 1930s.	1

67hpo19	1	a	"""But they are walking backwards now."""	1
67nyt25	1	a	While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security “to determine how each might — individually or in different combinations — impact the lives of current and future retirees.”	1
67hpo29	0	a	Rother's thinking, according to the paper, is that tax increases alone can't keep the program's $2.6 trillion trust fund from running out of money, so benefit cuts must be included as well.	0

98hpo1	0	a	Advocates are hoping for a plan that would give undocumented immigrants a chance to both remain in the country and eventually become citizens, but House Republicans have indicated that the latter is something most cannot support.	0
98nyt2	0	a	The document is expected to call for border security and enforcement measures, as well as providing a path to legal status — but not citizenship — for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, the aides said.	0
98hpo5	0	a	"There won't be amnesty inside it."""	0
98fox7	0	a	The path to legalization’s inclusion in the plan – which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.	0
98fox11	0	a	Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes.	0
98nyt7	0	a	But the legislation stalled in the Republican-controlled House, where some of the party’s more conservative members oppose any form of legal status as “amnesty.”	0

98nyt12	0	a	Representative Peter T.

98fox15	0	a	The president reportedly told the Democrats in a meeting that Republicans need to take action on immigration in order to keep the volatile issue from hurting their chances with Latino voters, as it appears to have done in 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney did extremely poorly with the increasingly important voting bloc.	0

98nyt18	0	a	Critics worry that House Republican leaders and Senate Democrats are essentially negotiating a final deal, bypassing formal House-Senate negotiations, where conservatives had hoped to derail the process.	0
98nyt6	0	a	The Senate, led by Democrats, passed a broad bipartisan measure in June to overhaul immigration that included a 13-year path to citizenship.	0
98nyt17	0	a	On Thursday, aides to House conservatives who oppose the leadership’s plan gathered in the office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce opponent of the immigration push, to plot a strategy to torpedo it.	0

98nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — House Republicans are preparing to unveil their own broad template for overhauling the nation’s immigration system this week, potentially offering a small opening for President Obama and congressional Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation before the end of the year.	0
98hpo2	0	a	Although he's expressed openness to legal status previously, his comments could be a hint at what's to come in the House GOP's plan to soon release its own principles for immigration reform.	0
98nyt8	0	a	But heading into the three-day Republican retreat, even some of the most ardent conservatives say consensus is forming around an immigration package that would include several separate bills on border security; a clampdown against the hiring of undocumented workers; expanded guest-worker programs; a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; and a path to legal status for undocumented workers with family ties to citizens or employer sponsors.	0
98nyt4	0	a	“The principles they lay out I’m sure won’t satisfy everybody,” Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, said at an immigration forum on Friday.	0
98nyt3	0	a	The Republican effort comes as Mr. Obama is expected to push once again for an overhaul of the immigration system in his State of the Union address Tuesday, and as lawmakers from both parties describe immigration as one of the few potential areas for bipartisan compromise before the end of the current Congress.	0
98hpo8	0	a	Immigration activists have targeted McCarthy specifically due to his high rank in the House GOP.	0
98fox10	0	a	That created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some – including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida – arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty.	0
98fox6	0	a	The House Republican immigration principles reportedly will cover how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, and how many of the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to various media stories.	0
98nyt1	0	a	Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders are expected to release a one-page statement of immigration principles this week at their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md., according to aides with knowledge of the plan.	0

2hpo7	0	a	To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.	0

2hpo3	1	a	“I could do the wall over a longer period of time ― I didn’t need to do this,” Trump said in a televised speech, even as he contended the situation on the southern border amounted to a national emergency.	1
2nyt20	0	a	“Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him.	0

2nyt7	0	a	The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move.	0
2nyt52	0	a	Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress.	0
2hpo1	0	a	Trump, who was accompanied by parents of children killed by unauthorized immigrants, said he was declaring the national emergency for “virtual invasion purposes.”	0
2hpo0	0	a	President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border in an effort to unilaterally seize funding to begin building his long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico.	0

2nyt32	0	a	Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.	0
2nyt49	0	a	Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward.	0
2hpo28	0	a	There is no national emergency,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement.	0
2fox5	0	a	"Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that ""walls work"" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation."	0
2hpo2	0	a	But he also acknowledged another reason: He didn’t want to wait on Congress to approve the funds.	0
2nyt4	0	a	But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action.	0

2fox27	0	a	The compromise package, which was negotiated for weeks in a bipartisan conference committee, passed both the House and the Senate on Thursday.	0
2hpo24	0	a	Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by “unlocking” new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.	0
2hpo34	0	a	In January, Trump asserted that he had “the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” according to CNN.	0
2hpo30	1	a	Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a “gross abuse of the power of the presidency” and vowed that “Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.”	1
2nyt2	0	a	“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought.	0
2nyt30	0	a	The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall.	0
2hpo35	0	a	He called it “the easy route” while insisting that he’d rather Congress approve his border wall funding.	0
2nyt28	0	a	The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it.	0
2fox34	0	a	Trump requested $5.7 billion for construction of the wall, while Democrats vowed to block any spending proposal that included such funding.	0
2nyt22	0	a	Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier.	0
2nyt67	0	a	Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.	0
2nyt63	0	a	The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall.	0
2nyt10	1	a	The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not.	1

2fox24	0	a	"According to the Congressional Research Service, there are at least 30 ""national emergencies"" in effect, including those concerning blocking Iranian government property, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other terror-related acts."	0
2fox25	0	a	But none of the emergencies have involved the president of the United States spending money that had not been specifically appropriated by Congress.	0
2hpo17	0	a	The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed.	0
2fox0	0	a	President Trump said Friday he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he signs a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security.	0
2hpo19	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision.	0
2hpo29	1	a	“If Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won’t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.”	1
2nyt37	0	a	The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land.	0
2nyt43	0	a	But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin.	0
2fox30	0	a	The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier.	0
2nyt33	0	a	The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans.	0
2nyt26	0	a	Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor.	0

2nyt61	0	a	In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year.	0
2fox3	0	a	But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package.	0

83hpo26	0	a	There is always a chance that grassroots fervor in support of Labrador could gain a level of intensity that Boehner and McCarthy did not anticipate.	0
83hpo27	0	a	However, there's not a lot of time for that to happen before next Thursday's election, and leadership elections generally are dominated by inside baseball politics and arcane political interests.	0
83hpo29	1	a	Labrador is an ambitious, sometimes savvy politician.	1
83nyt10	0	a	FreedomWorks, which has provided financial support for Tea Party candidates, immediately began trying to generate support for Mr. Labrador through its websites and email lists.	0

83nyt9	1	a	House conservatives — lacking a rationale to fight Mr. McCarthy, a well-liked member of leadership who has raised millions of dollars for Republican incumbents — have begun protesting that his voting record is actually to the left of Mr. Cantor’s.	1
83fox24	0	a	The Idaho congressman, echoing other conservatives, has said that Congress should wait until at least 2015 to take up the issue again because President Obama must make a clear attempt to take steps to secure the borders and step up interior enforcement of immigration laws.	0
83fox32	0	a	One of the conservative members in the House who wanted to postpone the June 19 vote for majority leader quickly indicated that for him, Labrador would not do.	0
83fox16	0	a	But some observers said Cantor’s tough stance toward the end of the primary – one he’d seemed confident he’d easily win – was too little too late.	0
83nyt12	0	a	Matt Kibbe, the group’s president and chief executive, said that he did not have great qualms with Mr. McCarthy’s ideology, but that he was more about politics than ideas.	0

83nyt26	0	a	Mr. Labrador tried on Friday to at least engage the Republican conference in a debate over ideas.	0
83hpo12	0	a	Since the 2010 midterm tea party wave election, the House GOP has contained a bloc of members who have opposed the establishment leadership time and time again.	0

83fox3	0	a	Labrador’s foray into the race for majority leader is yet another dramatic turn of events for Republicans, who were stunned by the defeat in Tuesday’s primary in Virginia of Rep.

83hpo21	0	a	The situation left House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the rest of the Republican leadership in the House with a problem: The 40 or so hardline tea party members of the House GOP do not want the response to Cantor's loss -- which was driven by grassroots discontent with the establishment -- to simply be more establishment leadership.	0

83hpo13	0	a	The tea party group has pulled other legislators to the right on a host of issues, including many related to government spending and debt.	0

83fox18	0	a	Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers.	0
83fox26	0	a	Labrador supports a path to legal status, but only after evidence that enforcement has been improved, he has said.	0
