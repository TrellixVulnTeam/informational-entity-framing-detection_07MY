10fox15	1	a	"""It is a failure to show Americans that while we seek a more perfect union, we do so from imperfect beginnings, through an imperfect history, with an imperfect government created by an imperfect document,"" he added."	1
10fox20	0	a	"He argued that the Founders were not ""demigods"" and that the document's needs for amendments to abolish slavery and other injustices showed it was ""highly imperfect."""	0
10hpo7	0	a	After handing out pocket-size Constitutions at rallies, after studying the document article by article and after demanding that Washington return to its founding principles, tea party activists have something new to applaud.	0
10nyt6	0	a	From there, members who wished to read were recognized from their seats, beginning with Representative Steve Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey.	0
10hpo21	0	a	Also on Thursday, the House is to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices.	0
10nyt3	0	a	It was decided in advance that any portion of the Constitution that was superseded by amendments — including the amendments themselves — would not be read, preventing lawmakers from having to make references to slaves, referred to in Article 1, Section 2 as “three fifths of all other persons,” or to things like prohibition.	0
10fox4	0	a	However, they did read the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition in 1933 and is still in force.	0
10nyt1	0	a	Like the Constitutional Convention itself, things did not begin auspiciously.	0
10hpo20	1	a	“These new rules show that Republicans are serious about respecting the Constitution.”	1
10hpo6	0	a	These are two standout changes on a long list of new rules Republicans will institute in the House when they assume the majority on Jan. 5.	0
10hpo11	1	a	Under axiomatic legal precedent, virtually all congressional action is presumed valid anyway, at least initially.	1
10hpo1	0	a	Those wondering whether the reading would be dramatic found out on Thursday as volunteers gave voice to the seven articles and 27 amendments that make up the nation’s governing document.	0
10fox27	0	a	"I think it's a valuable exercise and an important moment in this Congress for us to read the Constitution,"" said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y."	0
10nyt7	0	a	And so, sentence by sentence, in accents that reflect the myriad districts that did not even exist when the document came into being, by women and African Americans whose full rights were not recognized at that time, the constitutional language fluttered through the chamber.	0
10hpo13	1	a	It is also quite obvious, from 223 years of legal and political debate on the topic, that the text of the Constitution itself, including those portions that deal with legislative power, is susceptible to many different (and often evolving) views and interpretations, a practical reality that would likely render most “Constitutional Authority Statements” controversial and contentious.”	1
10hpo22	0	a	Republicans have estimated that this will save $35 million over the next nine months.	0
10fox35	0	a	"If that were so, it would never have been ratified in the first place,"" he said."	0
10fox11	0	a	Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., commented that the original document has been changed through amendment, leaving the the reader to interpret the operative language.	0

10nyt15	0	a	The order of reading was ironed out at the last minute, with the goal of letting all who wished to read do so, but making sure there was party parity, Mr. Goodlatte said.	0
10fox19	1	a	"Nadler derided what he called the ""ritualistic reading"" as ""total nonsense"" and ""propaganda"" intended to give Republicans claim to the document."	1
10fox24	0	a	"""I think that this is a very symbolic showing to the American people and reminder to the members of congress that we are a government of laws not of men and that this Constitution is the foundation for all of our laws,"" Goodlatte said."	0
10fox25	0	a	And backers said that it wouldn't hurt to try to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers.	0
10fox6	0	a	Portions of the U.S. Constitution are never deleted, just amended, as has been done 27 times in history.	0
10fox0	1	a	Even for a Congress known to battle over every little detail, reading the U.S. Constitution aloud sounded like a simple exercise.	1
10fox33	0	a	Pilon added that the Founders never intended for the Constitution to be viewed as fluid advice.	0
10nyt14	0	a	To wit, the document reading happened on the same day that House Republicans began the contentious process of repealing the health care law, which they have long said lacks constitutional basis.	0
10hpo12	0	a	Moreover, by taking their oaths of office, lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution, and virtually all legislation is vetted for constitutional support on some level by government lawyers before it makes it to committee or to the floor of the House.	0
10nyt17	0	a	According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, the only two prior instances in which a full or partial text of the Constitution was inserted into the Congressional Record was in 1882, when Roswell Flower of New York “appended” a text of the Constitution — minus the amendments — into the record, and in 1915, when Thomas Reilly of Connecticut inserted the full text of the Constitution into the Congressional Record as an extension of his remarks.	0
10hpo18	0	a	“We always hear members of Congress talking about swearing an oath to represent their constituents, when in reality the only oath we take is to the Constitution,” explained newly-minted Speaker John Boehner to the Post.	0
10fox8	0	a	And that was the point of contention for Democratic lawmakers who complained that exempting parts of the document from the reading undermines the objective of the exercise.	0
10hpo15	0	a	“The amount I get is nearly $1.1 million.	0
10nyt11	0	a	“Throughout the last year there has been a great debate about the expansion of the federal government, and lots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution,” said Mr. Goodlatte, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over constitutional amendments.	0
10nyt12	0	a	He added: “I think it is important that we send a message to people at home that the constitution is an important document.”	0
10fox7	0	a	But all the original decisions remain in the Constitution, including in the copies authorized by Congress' Joint Committee on Printing and used in Thursday's reading.	0
10hpo9	0	a	Politics Daily recently reported:	0
10fox16	0	a	"""We fail to show the American people that imperfection is not to be feared and that our ability to constantly improve on what the Founders gave us is a blessing, not a reason for divisiveness."""	0
10fox31	0	a	"""Today the Congress regulates our lives and redistributes our wealth in ways that would shock the Founders,"" he said."	0
10fox17	0	a	Other lawmakers decried the exercise altogether, saying the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter.	0
10nyt0	0	a	Setting the tone for the 112th Congress — in which every House bill must cite the constitutional source of its authority — members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber’s floor on Thursday morning.	0
10fox13	0	a	"Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the reading of the ""amended"" Constitution."	0
10hpo5	0	a	“Call it the tea party-ization of Congress. ...	0
10hpo14	1	a	According to Peter Keating at Vanity Fair, $1.1 million is the estimated cost of GOP plans to read the document on the House floor. 	1
10fox29	1	a	"Historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia University told Fox News the reading may be ""a bit of theater,"" but it is ""not insignificant given that many Republicans have decided -- implausibly, in my opinion -- that the Constitution is the vehicle that can reduce the size of government."""	1
10nyt18	0	a	But the office could not find any examples of the full text of the Constitution actually being read out loud on the House Floor.	0
10fox26	0	a	"""I don't think the Constitution is propaganda."	0
10hpo4	0	a	The Washington Post reported last week that reading the founding document in full appears to be a first in the chamber’s 221-year history:	0
10nyt10	0	a	Largely, it was meant to instruct members, who now must use it to underlie their bills, and to inform voters.	0
10nyt9	0	a	The reading of the document on the floor of the House, an act that is part of the new rules package, serves several purposes, said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who came up with the idea for the live reading.	0
10nyt5	0	a	Once that was settled, just after 11 a.m., Representative John A. Boehner, the newly installed speaker of the House, read the preamble (that magical “We the people”), before yielding to the woman who handed him the gavel on Wednesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1 (“All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives”), followed by Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other House leaders.	0
10nyt8	1	a	At one point, there was yelling in the chamber, and the sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester.	1
10fox23	1	a	But for all those who described the exercise as political waste -- including Vanity Fair magazine, which estimated it as costing more than $1 million -- supporters noted that it was an historic moment -- the first time the U.S. Constitution had been read on the U.S. House floor.	1
10fox37	0	a	"""John Boehner and his cronies are holding up the U.S. Constitution as a sacred, perfect document."	0
10fox30	0	a	But Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute said Congress needs to re-read the Constitution to be reminded how out of control government has become.	0

10fox21	1	a	"""You are not supposed to worship your Constitution,"" he told the newspaper."	1
10fox36	0	a	As the Constitution was being read inside the lower chamber, Nadler and others gathered outside the Capitol to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, a perennial effort to update the document with a statement on women.	0
10fox22	0	a	"""You are supposed to govern your government by it."""	0
10fox18	1	a	"""They are reading it like a sacred text,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the former chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told The Washington Post."	1

10fox34	0	a	"""When liberals tell today that the Constitution is essentially a blank slate to be filled by transient majorities, nothing could be further from the truth."	0
10nyt4	1	a	These inquiries about parliamentary procedure were not well received, and for several minutes, before a word of the preamble could be uttered, Democrats and Republicans battled back and forth over the issue of language, perhaps presaging future partisan battles over the meaning, purpose and application of the document.	1
10fox3	0	a	For instance, lawmakers did not read the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition on liquor in 1919.	0
10fox14	0	a	"""To not read the full document, including all the text that was later amended, is to fail to acknowledge the struggle our nation has constantly fought, within and without, to 'keep' our Republic,"" he said in a written statement."	0
24nyt38	0	a	At the end of that week, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks released more than 6,000 emails related to John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign.	0
24fox38	0	a	Former campaign adviser Rick Gates in 2018 pleaded guilty and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted and later pleaded guilty in a separate financial crimes case dating back before the 2016 election.	0
24nyt20	0	a	After that, according to the indictment, the Trump campaign sought more.	0
24fox20	0	a	But former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as “outrageous.”	0
24nyt2	0	a	The effort began weeks after Democratic officials publicly accused Russian intelligence operatives of the theft, which was part of Moscow’s broad campaign to sabotage the 2016 presidential race.	0
24nyt39	0	a	The release, 30 minutes after The Washington Post published a recording of Mr. Trump bragging about assaulting women, appeared aimed at redirecting negative attention from Mr. Trump to the Clinton campaign.	0

24nyt1	0	a	A top Trump campaign official dispatched Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, to get information from WikiLeaks about the thousands of hacked Democratic emails, according to an indictment.	0
24fox15	0	a	“The wild card here is that in charging Stone with a form of obstruction of justice, the Mueller team may view it differently than typical white-collar investigations.”	0
24fox25	0	a	“Make no mistake,” he said. 	0

24nyt4	1	a	In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts — even a reference to “The Godfather: Part II” — Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering.	1

24nyt6	0	a	F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn.	0
24nyt43	0	a	He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stone’s.	0
24nyt26	0	a	He sometimes seemed to taunt American law enforcement agencies, daring them to find hard evidence to link him to Moscow’s interference; it is illegal for a political campaign to accept foreign aid.	0
24nyt49	0	a	On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friend’s house in the morning darkness.	0

24nyt24	1	a	A self-described dirty trickster, Mr. Stone began his career as a Nixon campaign aide and has a tattoo of Nixon on his back.	1
24fox0	0	a	The FBI's pre-dawn arrest of President Trump's ex-adviser Roger Stone at his Florida home prompted critics to once again question the tactics of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after more than a dozen special agents clad in tactical gear raided Stone's property Friday.	0
24nyt7	0	a	Agents typically use those tactics as a precaution to secure possible evidence and protect themselves in case a suspect fights arrest.	0
24nyt14	1	a	“I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,” he added, then flashed twin V-for-victory hand signs reminiscent of his political hero, former President Richard M. Nixon.	1
24fox16	0	a	He added: “If the FBI and the Mueller team believe Stone has engaged in witness tampering, then there is a palpable distrust, which would make them err on the side of surprise, rather than a courtesy phone call.”	0
24fox26	1	a	“This was designed to be vindictive and intimidating.”	1
24nyt40	0	a	The special counsel’s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaks’ document releases in the months before the election.	0

24fox13	0	a	A former senior Justice Department official, now-white collar criminal attorney with Ifrah Law, James Trusty, told Fox News that while common procedure in white collar cases would involve a federal prosecutor contacting the defendant’s attorney, Stone’s charges could have sparked a different approach.	0
