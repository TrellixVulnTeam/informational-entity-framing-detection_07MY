12nyt6	0	a	The recommendations — which also included expanding the police presence in schools — drew immediate criticism from gun control advocates and many Democrats, who have been fighting to tighten gun restrictions after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December.	0
12hpo4	0	a	At Tuesday's press conference, he stated that its findings were independent of the nation's largest gun lobby.	0
12fox5	0	a	Hutchinson, though, did call for the creation of a 40-60 hour training program for armed officers.	0

12nyt1	0	a	WASHINGTON — With the Senate set to debate gun control this month, a National Rifle Association task force released a 225-page report on Tuesday that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school, and urged states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons.	0
12nyt23	1	a	But how and whether the task force recommendations will be put into effect — and the cost — was unclear.	1
12hpo21	0	a	But the recommendation that states allow non-law enforcement officers, such as teachers and principals, to carry guns in schools would essentially eliminate gun-free school zones.	0
12fox10	1	a	Mark Mattioli, the father of one Newtown shooting victim, also spoke after Hutchinson's announcement to applaud the review effort.	1
12hpo17	0	a	The report marks the culmination of a controversial process that began in December, when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre held a press conference the week after the shooting in Newtown, Conn.	0
12nyt18	0	a	At least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea of armed officers at schools.	0
12fox6	0	a	"To accompany that, his group proposed a ""model"" state law that would allow certain personnel who have undergone this training to carry weapons on school grounds."	0
12nyt20	0	a	The task force panel called on the Departments of Homeland Security, Education and Justice to coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks.	0
12nyt5	0	a	He cited a 1997 Mississippi case in which an assistant principal ran to his truck to retrieve a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol and subdued a gunman who had killed two students.	0
12hpo15	0	a	The NRA also put out a statement on the report, over which the gun lobby insists it had no influence.	0
12nyt12	0	a	But critics see no distinction between the two.	0
12hpo13	0	a	Hutchinson's report and his press conference were both met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which supports broader gun control measures and strongly opposes arming educators.	0
12fox9	0	a	The 225-page report also called for states to require schools to conduct a safety assessment and for a pilot program to be created assessing mental health as a pre-indicator for violence.	0
12hpo18	0	a	At the time, LaPierre assailed the media and gun control advocates for their responses to the massacre, and he proposed that armed volunteers protect schools and that gun-free school zones be eliminated.	0
12nyt14	0	a	But the report did get support from at least one Newtown parent: Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James, was killed.	0
12hpo3	0	a	The report was prepared by a 12-person task force, called the School Shield Program, led by Hutchinson.	0
12fox15	0	a	He argued that if banks and members of Congress can have protection, schools across America should be afforded the same security.	0
12nyt11	0	a	Technically, Mr. Hutchison’s task force is independent of the rifle association, even though it paid for the study, and Mr. LaPierre was not present on Tuesday.	0
12nyt10	0	a	After the Newtown shooting, Wayne LaPierre, the rifle association’s executive director, announced that it would devise a plan to put armed guards in every school.	0
12nyt13	1	a	Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children’s Defense Fund, an advocacy group here, criticized the study as “nothing more than a continuation of the N.R.A.’s attempts to prey on America’s fears, saturate our schools with more guns and turn them into armed fortresses.”	1

14nyt15	0	a	He told him to “man up” and make a decision so that the case will not be further delayed.	0
14hpo36	0	a	“We need concrete action to change things in this country,” he said, according to excerpts provided by the Justice Department.	0

14nyt20	0	a	In an open letter to the people of Ferguson, Mr. Holder said he understood the desire of residents for an “independent” inquiry.	0

14hpo30	0	a	I think if you do something right from the bottom, the top doesn’t have to jump in.	0
14nyt32	0	a	Then a curfew was imposed. The next night, there was no curfew.	0
14nyt38	0	a	And the police also seemed more restrained, refraining from using tear gas.	0
14hpo1	0	a	The issues raised by Michael Brown's death, Holder said, have simmered “beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson.”	0
14nyt41	0	a	In some instances, teams of officers abruptly entered the crowd, detained a single person whom they had apparently focused on, and returned to West Florissant Avenue, where many of the recent confrontations have occurred.	0
