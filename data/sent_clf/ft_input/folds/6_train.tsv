11fox6	0	a	The shutdown was sparked by disagreement over President Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall or steel barrier on the southern border. 	0
11hpo4	1	a	The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ― a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker.	1

11nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — President Trump agreed on Friday to reopen the federal government for three weeks while negotiations continued over how to secure the nation’s southwestern border, backing down after a monthlong standoff failed to force Democrats to give him billions of dollars for his long-promised wall.	0
11nyt49	1	a	Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details.	1
11nyt36	1	a	Mr. Trump offered no explanation for his surrender, nor did he acknowledge that it was one.	1
11nyt58	0	a	At another point, during an exchange first reported by The Washington Post, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, vented at Mr. McConnell for putting Republicans in the position of having to vote on two competing approaches to reopen the government — one Republican and one Democratic — without consulting them first.	0
11nyt27	1	a	As he announced the deal, Mr. Trump paid tribute to the federal workers who have endured five weeks without pay, expressing sympathy for them in a way he had not until now.	1
11hpo10	0	a	“We’re going in that direction but we’re not to that place,” said Pelosi.	0
11nyt10	0	a	The surprise announcement was a remarkable surrender for a president who made the wall his nonnegotiable condition for reopening the government and a centerpiece of his political platform.	0
11nyt3	1	a	The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.	1
11nyt46	0	a	A Democratic bill, which would have reopened the government with no strings attached, received more votes than the bill backed by Mr. Trump, which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.	0
11nyt20	0	a	But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past.	0

11nyt40	0	a	Mr. Trump began his remarks as if he had actually emerged victorious, saying that he was “very proud to announce” what he called “a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.”	0
11fox4	0	a	The deal appeared to include no money for a wall or steel barrier, but he said he hoped negotiations would continue to come to an agreement on wall funding.	0
11fox20	1	a	However, Democrats rejected the plan even before Trump announced it, and a Senate version of the plan failed to get the 60 votes needed on Thursday. 	1
11nyt16	0	a	“None of us are willing to go through this again,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, referring to a half-dozen Republicans who voted on Thursday for a Democratic measure to reopen the government for two weeks.	0
11nyt14	0	a	Mr. Trump relented as the effects of the shutdown were rippling with ever greater force across the economy, with fallout far beyond paychecks.	0
11hpo5	1	a	If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding ― a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts.	1

11nyt45	0	a	The president’s concession came a day after two competing measures to reopen the government failed on the Senate floor.	0
11fox22	1	a	"On Thursday, Trump had promised that Republicans “will not cave"" on border wall demands."	1
11fox11	1	a	"He suggested that a ""prorated down payment"" on the wall, without providing a concrete dollar figure, could be viable."	1
11nyt7	0	a	But Mr. Trump has already adopted some of the language that his Democratic adversaries have used during the longest shutdown in history.	0
11nyt48	0	a	Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of offering a down payment for the wall to reopen the government and pitched Mr. McConnell on what ultimately became the agreement with Mr. Trump, according to a senior Democratic aide.	0

11nyt56	0	a	“We’ve already lost,” lamented Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, according to people familiar with the remarks.	0
11nyt8	0	a	He conceded that “we do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea — we never did” and invoked the utility of “smart walls” that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors.	0
11fox5	0	a	"""Walls should not be controversial,"" he said."	0
11nyt2	0	a	Mr. Trump signed it on Friday night, restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and opening the way to paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days.	0
11hpo14	0	a	Trump spent most of his speech on Friday rehashing his usual talking points about crime at the border.	0
11nyt50	0	a	To the Republican leader, it was a way to ease much of the pressure on federal workers and get the Senate back to work.	0
11nyt44	0	a	Over the next three weeks, a House-Senate conference committee representing both parties will negotiate a border security plan, but if it fails to reach a consensus, government agencies could close again.	0
11hpo9	0	a	She was mum on whether she considered his proposal a final deal.	0

11nyt11	0	a	Some immigration hard-liners that make up a key part of his political base were incensed by the capitulation.	0
11nyt34	1	a	And though the long-term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen, it appears that at the very least the short-term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall.	1
11nyt37	0	a	On Twitter on Friday night, he said: “This was in no way a concession.	0
11nyt59	0	a	“You put us in this position,” Mr. Johnson said, according to one of his aides.	0

11nyt33	0	a	Its compounding effects will ultimately cost the federal government more money than if it was open.	0

30hpo11	0	a	According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.	0

30nyt20	0	a	And as the hearing continued, Republicans and Democrats pressed ahead with one point on which they agree these days: that an inept I.R.S. had committed serious misdeeds.	0
30nyt14	0	a	Ms. Lerner then left the hearing room with her lawyer to a whir of camera shutters.	0

30nyt12	0	a	Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind.	0
30hpo6	0	a	That apology was planned ahead of time by the IRS, and came in response to a planted question.	0

30hpo8	0	a	Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal.	0

69fox16	0	a	Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip, from $11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $10.1 million the following year.	0
69nyt24	1	a	What difference, at this point, does it make?” Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising.	1
69nyt11	0	a	In essence, Mrs. Clinton’s approach was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in Benghazi but not the blame.	0
69nyt15	0	a	When the question of her role was taken up again in the afternoon hearing by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had been briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack.	0
69fox33	0	a	"Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said ""somebody within your office should have seen this cable."""	0
69nyt37	0	a	Mrs. Clinton sought to put the events in Benghazi in a regional context, noting the presence of a group in northern Mali affiliated with Al Qaeda.	0
69hpo12	1	a	The added complexity wasn't always satisfying to the legislators who grilled her Wednesday.	1
69nyt1	0	a	WASHINGTON — In one of her final appearances as secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday vigorously defended her handling of last September’s attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans and prompted a scathing review of State Department procedures.	0
69hpo3	0	a	"""And I say that because in the unclassified ARB, it is -- I quote: 'Key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators remain to be determined.'"""	0
69hpo2	0	a	"""As the ARB makes clear, after their months of research the picture remains still somewhat complicated,"" Clinton said, during an exchange with Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho) at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."	0
69fox15	0	a	It's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi.	0
69nyt9	0	a	It also has enormous political implications for Mrs. Clinton, the former New York senator who is already regarded as the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination if she chooses to run.	0
69nyt19	0	a	Since then, she has committed herself to putting in place all of the recommendations of an independent review that was led by Thomas R. Pickering, a former American ambassador, and Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.	0
69hpo5	1	a	That the administration wavered over its public declarations of the cause of the assault -- repeatedly citing the video before eventually confirming that it was clearly an act of terrorism -- was widely interpreted among critics as evidence of a desire to suppress or conceal the truth.	1
69fox22	0	a	Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role.	0
69nyt10	0	a	It was the first time she had faced extensive questioning about her role in the episode.	0
69fox38	0	a	"The secretary tried to explain that ""1.43 million cables"" come through the department every year."	0
69nyt14	0	a	I didn’t see those requests. They didn’t come to me. I didn’t approve them. I didn’t deny them.”	0
69hpo14	0	a	"""There are key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators that remain to be determined,"" she said."	0
69fox12	0	a	It steadily climbed to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2010.	0
69fox29	1	a	But, to the dismay of lawmakers, Clinton repeatedly said she never saw it.	1
69fox30	0	a	"""That cable did not come to my attention."	0
69fox21	0	a	"Asked again about budget issues, Lamb said: ""Sir, if it's a volatile situation, we will move assets to cover that."""	0
69nyt8	0	a	The continuing controversy over the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, has cast a cloud over Mrs. Clinton’s final months at the State Department.	0
69nyt18	0	a	Mrs. Clinton first publicly took responsibility for the Sept. 11 attack in an Oct. 15 interview with television reporters.	0
69nyt22	1	a	Republicans have repeatedly charged that Obama administration officials deliberately played down the attack, focusing much of their criticism on Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and once Mr. Obama’s choice to succeed Mrs. Clinton.	1
69hpo8	0	a	The Times later stood by that version of events, citing it in its fact-check of Republican attacks on Obama during the presidential campaign.	0
69fox39	0	a	They are addressed to her but in many cases do not go to her.	0
69fox35	0	a	And this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office.	0
69nyt26	0	a	Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, began his questions by saying, “It’s wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever,” and then proceeded to complain that she had failed to answer lingering questions.	0
69nyt2	1	a	“As I have said many times, I take responsibility, and nobody is more committed to getting this right,” she said, reading a statement during a day of testimony before Senate and House committees.	1
69fox27	0	a	"That cable summarized an emergency meeting the day before by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi and warned the consulate could not defend against a ""coordinated attack."""	0
69fox34	0	a	"""An emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on Aug. 16 by the ambassador himself, warning of what could happen."	0
69nyt0	0	a	Facing Congress, Clinton Defends Her Actions Before and After Libya Attack	0
69fox26	0	a	Another pivotal issue Wednesday dealt with an Aug. 16 cable.	0
69hpo10	0	a	But the classified version, Clinton said, detailed the possible motivations for the attack, and suggested while they were pre-coordinated and deliberate, they were also opportunistic and not planned extensively.	0
69nyt4	1	a	But Mrs. Clinton, whose appearance before Congress had been postponed since December because of illness, quickly departed from the script.	1
69fox43	1	a	"He claimed that not knowing about their security requests ""really, I think, cost these people their lives."""	1
69hpo4	0	a	The question of what motivated the Benghazi attacks has often been viewed as a duality: Either it was the result of a mob angry over a recently released anti-Islamic video, or it was a terrorist attack.	0
69fox4	0	a	Assertions that State Department posts are left vulnerable because Congress has decided not to fully fund security requests pervaded Wednesday's hearings.	0
69hpo1	0	a	Speaking at a pair of hearings on Capitol Hill to examine the Obama administration's handling of and response to the attacks, Clinton repeatedly cited the classified version of the review by a State Department Accountability Review Board, distributed to lawmakers last month.	0
69fox10	0	a	And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004.	0
69hpo17	0	a	"It's pretty clear what the motivation was."""	0
69nyt34	0	a	To avoid the perception of a conflict of interest, the hearing on Wednesday was led by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, the incoming chairman, and Mr. Kerry did not attend.	0
69nyt16	0	a	They included the placement of a bomb at the outer wall of the compound in June and an ambush that month on the British ambassador.	0
69nyt39	0	a	“The Arab revolutions have scrambled power dynamics and shattered security forces across the region.	0
69nyt6	0	a	“I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews,” she said.	0
69fox41	0	a	Republicans argue the Aug. 16 cable was rather high priority.	0
69fox42	0	a	"As Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., put it, ""Libya has to have been one of the hottest of hot spots around the world."""	0
69nyt27	0	a	Mr. McCain asserted that the Obama administration’s aversion to nation-building had precluded it from providing the kind of training and assistance that would have helped the fledgling Libyan government in Tripoli confront growing security threats from militants.	0
69fox1	0	a	Republicans are challenging a host of statements made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Democratic allies during Wednesday's heated Libya testimony -- claiming that complaints about a lack of funding are bogus and questioning the secretary's insistence she never saw urgent cables warning about the danger of an attack.	0
69fox8	0	a	Democrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years, and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested.	0
69nyt3	0	a	“I am determined to leave the State Department and our country safer, stronger and more secure.”	0
69fox6	0	a	"Clinton, in turn, affirmed their claims, saying budget issues are a ""bipartisan problem."""	0
69fox36	0	a	"That's the bottom line,"" he said."	0
69nyt30	0	a	A persistent line of questioning by Republican lawmakers concerned the initial comments from Ms. Rice that the attack might have resulted from a protest, over an anti-Islamic video, that spun out of control.	0
69fox9	0	a	But Congress often scales back the administration's requests, and not just for the State Department.	0
69nyt32	0	a	“I told the American people that heavily armed militants assaulted our compound, and I vowed to bring them to justice,” Mrs. Clinton said.	0
69nyt36	0	a	“This is an opportunity for this committee to finally do the work that it should have been doing for years,” Mr. Corker said.	0
69hpo16	0	a	"To which Duncan replied: ""It was a terrorist attack."	0
69nyt40	0	a	And instability in Mali has created an expanding safe haven for terrorists who look to extend their influence and plot further attacks of the kind we saw just last week in Algeria.”	0

37hpo16	1	a	“It’s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,” summarized Senor. 	1
37hpo13	0	a	Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steele’s comments are “utterly irresponsible.”	0
37nyt5	1	a	His remarks were the latest in a string of controversial statements that he has made as party chairman.	1
37fox2	0	a	"Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., would not go that far but said Steele must apologize to the troops."	0

37fox8	0	a	"He called Steele's comments ""unacceptable"" and ""inaccurate."""	0
37hpo17	0	a	In a bit of irony, Steele’s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise.	0
37fox9	0	a	"""We need a chairman who's focused,"" DeMint said."	0
37fox0	0	a	"Republican senators kept up pressure on party Chairman Michael Steele Sunday to better explain -- and publicly apologize for -- his on-camera claim that Afghanistan is a ""war of Obama's choosing"" and may not be winnable."	0
37hpo11	0	a	Kristol’s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy. 	0
37hpo15	0	a	Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is “’a war we have to win” — a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: “...you don’t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who’s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.” 	0
37nyt20	0	a	In his statement on Friday afternoon, Mr. Steele did not respond to the call for his resignation.	0
37fox11	0	a	"The Arizona Republican said Steele needs to assess whether he can still function in his job and must make ""an appropriate decision"" about his future."	0
37nyt11	0	a	It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.”	0
37hpo5	0	a	Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your statement “puts [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party.	0
37hpo2	0	a	“Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not “a war of Obama’s choosing.”	0
37fox15	0	a	That didn't seem to quiet the controversy in the slightest.	0
37fox1	0	a	The backlash built quickly over the weekend as some prominent conservatives called for Steele's resignation.	0
37fox7	0	a	"DeMint, who said Afghanistan is a war the United States must win, said Steele needs to ""refocus"" on the November election."	0
37nyt9	1	a	“Your tenure has, of course, been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, but I for one have never paid much attention to them, and have never thought they would matter much to the success of the causes and principles we share,” Mr. Kristol wrote Friday.	1
37nyt8	0	a	Mr. Steele’s comments prompted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and a leading voice of conservative support for the war in Afghanistan, to call for Mr. Steele’s resignation as party leader.	0
37hpo21	0	a	Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steele’s troubles would spread far and wide.	0
37nyt2	1	a	“It was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be Afghanistan,” Mr. Steele said, according to a video of his remarks that was circulated by Democrats on Friday.	1
37nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund-raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, a military fight he called “a war of Obama’s choosing.”	0
37hpo19	0	a	But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit.	0
37nyt15	0	a	Republican officials dismissed that criticism.	0
37fox17	0	a	"""I think it would be better if he went,"" he said."	0
37nyt26	0	a	The stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in Afghanistan.”	0
37nyt19	0	a	Republican officials did not dispute the authenticity of the video, but disputed its characterization.	0
37fox12	0	a	"Trying to quell the furor, Steele issued a statement saying: ""There is no question that America must win the war on terror."	0
37hpo1	0	a	The pushback crested with Bill Kristol — still an influential voice among Republican lawmakers — writing a letter to Steele on his Weekly Standard site calling for the RNC leader’s resignation.	0
37nyt25	0	a	He added, with a reference to Gen. David H. Petraeus: “That is why I supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire United States Senate, I support General Petraeus’s confirmation.	0

37hpo12	0	a	But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone.	0
37fox6	1	a	The GOP chairman is known for off-the-cuff and occasionally troublesome comments, but the Afghanistan remarks were too much to bear for some war-supporting Republicans.	1
37nyt7	0	a	Mr. Obama shifted the focus on the war on terrorism from Iraq to Afghanistan and last year announced his plan to send 30,000 more troops there.	0
37hpo18	0	a	They also, in some respects, echo the opinions of some members of the conservative community (Joe Scarborough and George Will among them) who have been critical of the deployment of U.S. forces in that country. 	0

37hpo0	0	a	Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. 	0

37hpo14	1	a	Senor, who served under the Bush administration as chief spokesman in Iraq and has been a major booster of efforts to escalate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, noted that Steele’s RNC actually sponsored a conference call for his group to praise Obama’s Afghan surge last year. 	1
37fox16	0	a	"Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge of conservatives calling for Steele to step down over the remark, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Steele still needs to go -- though he said Steele tried to convince him otherwise."	0

26nyt43	0	a	Yet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.	0
26fox7	0	a	"Despite Trump saying conversations had ""come a long way,"" Democrats were more dour in their assessment. "	0
26nyt39	0	a	Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.	0

26nyt35	0	a	Wednesday’s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion.	0
26fox31	0	a	The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership. 	0
26nyt4	0	a	Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion.	0
26fox20	0	a	Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers. 	0
26nyt22	0	a	The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting.	0
26hpo1	0	a	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border.	0
26fox13	0	a	Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens. 	0
26fox30	1	a	"""There is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck,"" she said"	1
26nyt5	0	a	Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security.	0
26fox28	0	a	Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall.	0
26nyt48	0	a	Outside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent.	0
26hpo28	0	a	Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall.	0
26nyt30	0	a	“No, not $2.5 billion, no — we’re asking for $5.6” billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.	0
26hpo8	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.	0
26nyt27	1	a	But the path to such a deal is murky at best.	1
26hpo5	0	a	“We’re asking the president to open the government,” she told reporters on the White House driveway.	0
26hpo16	0	a	When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “As long as it takes,” calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of “national security.”	0
26fox8	0	a	"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them ""he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”"	0
26nyt34	0	a	Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.	0
26nyt6	0	a	The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.	0
26hpo25	0	a	In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the “bollard fencing” developed during President Barack Obama’s administration.	0
26nyt23	0	a	A second official who attended said Mr. Trump’s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker.	0
26fox37	0	a	"On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' “Tucker Carlson Tonight” that the terms of the negotiations were clear: ""Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal."""	0
26nyt28	0	a	Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient.	0
26fox33	0	a	“We need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre,” he told reporters.	0
26hpo10	0	a	Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.	0
26nyt50	0	a	Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.	0
26hpo26	0	a	In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.	0
26hpo17	0	a	Trump’s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019.	0
26nyt19	0	a	The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.	0
26nyt53	0	a	She noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks.	0
26nyt21	0	a	It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.	0
26fox0	0	a	"President Trump stood firm Friday on his demands for a border wall after the second White House meeting with congressional leaders this week broke up with no apparent deal, warning Democrats the partial government shutdown could last ""years"" and saying he could even declare a ""national emergency"" to bypass Congress if necessary."	0
26nyt42	1	a	“It was incredibly disheartening that they don’t want to know the facts when making policy.”	1
26fox21	0	a	Ahead of the meeting Trump sent a letter to members of Congress congratulating Pelosi on her election as speaker and calling on Congress to re-open the government.	0
26nyt36	0	a	It was the president’s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall — and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.	0
26hpo7	1	a	Why would he not do that?”	1
26hpo15	0	a	Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.	0
26fox19	0	a	Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall.	0
26fox12	0	a	"""Steel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like we’re talking about steel because the other side feels better about it,"" he said."	0
26nyt7	0	a	Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.	0
26hpo13	0	a	Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then.	0
26fox2	0	a	“I may do it,” he said, before adding, “If we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving it a shot.”	0
26nyt52	1	a	“This morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,” Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.	1
26fox14	0	a	"She said there had been progress only in the sense of a ""better understanding"" of each other."	0

26nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting — the first in 22 days — could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump’s demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.	0
26nyt47	1	a	Mr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.	1

26nyt10	0	a	With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.	0

26fox5	0	a	"""This is national security we’re talking about, we’re not talking about games,"" he told reporters. "	0
26nyt31	1	a	His rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.	1
26fox15	0	a	Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend. 	0

26nyt1	0	a	During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats’ proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.	0
26fox18	1	a	The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump’s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives. 	1
26fox10	0	a	"He said it could be opened ""very quickly"" if they come to an agreement on the wall. "	0
26fox27	0	a	Democrats, meanwhile, passed legislation in the House that would fund the whole government, but not the wall.  	0
26hpo11	0	a	Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.	0

26hpo18	1	a	Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis’ performance and the late Sen. John McCain’s vote against Trump’s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.	1
26nyt25	0	a	In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: “I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.	0

0hpo15	0	a	"John McCain's plan, it's not the change we need."""	0
0hpo10	0	a	Republicans also used the charge that Obamacare raided Medicare as a primary attack line in the 2010 congressional elections.	0

0fox20	0	a	The Obama campaign is disputing that argument.	0

0nyt25	0	a	Those expansions, he said, include subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy private insurance.	0
0hpo9	0	a	Part of the reason that the Obama campaign is crying foul over this line of criticism, however, may be because it knows how effective it can be.	0

0nyt34	0	a	Mr. Ryan and Mr. Obama would impose similar overall constraints on Medicare spending, stipulating that average spending per beneficiary should not grow faster than the economy, measured by the per capita output of goods and services, plus one-half of one percentage point.	0

0hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- In the wake of Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee, the politics of Medicare have become almost as complicated as the policy itself.	0

0hpo24	0	a	The more substantive criticism concerned McCain's proposal to tax worker health care plans as a way of generating money to give people a new tax credit so that they could buy private insurance.	0
0fox11	0	a	The ad says: “You paid in to Medicare for years … now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare.	0

0hpo18	0	a	Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain's policy director at the time, recalled that the attack originated with a Wall Street Journal article that referenced his saying that McCain would assume savings in Medicare and Medicaid spending to make his health care plan budget neutral.	0

0fox42	0	a	Ryan also discussed his affection for novelist Ayn Rand, saying “Atlas Shrugged” triggered his interest in economics.	0
0fox8	0	a	The Obama campaign used that line Monday in a Web video timed for Romney’s arrival in Florida, with its large senior population.	0

0fox45	0	a	“You may have heard that Governor Romney just chose his running mate, Congressman Ryan.	0

41nyt11	1	a	Mr. Romney has said that he favors allowing domestic partnerships that bestow certain rights on same-sex couples, like hospital visitation, but he has not delineated them in great detail.	1
41nyt3	0	a	On Wednesday, in anticipation of Mr. Obama’s announcement, Mr. Romney laid out his belief that marriage — and anything resembling it — should be restricted to heterosexual couples, even as he acknowledged that it was “a very tender and sensitive topic.”	0
41nyt9	0	a	Nine states, including California, Delaware and New Jersey, now allow civil unions and broad domestic partnerships that most likely fit Mr. Romney’s description of marriage-like arrangements, meaning that they would be in the cross hairs of a President Romney, who supports a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.	0

41hpo6	0	a	Romney said he supports states' rights to make decisions on domestic partnership benefits, including hospital visitation.	0
41fox10	0	a	Last year Romney had signed a pledge sponsored by the National Organization for Marriage promising to support a federal ammendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman.	0
41nyt10	0	a	Those states offer an array of different rights to same-sex couples, among them the ability to pool resources for tax purposes, place a spouse on an employee health care plan and inherit property after a death.	0
41nyt22	0	a	But at the time, same-sex marriage was a little-discussed item on the agenda of national gay rights leaders, and aides say Mr. Romney has consistently opposed both marriage and civil unions that resemble marriage for gay couples.	0
41nyt13	0	a	Republicans and Democrats, in their reactions to the president’s support for same-sex marriage, said they saw a newly wide, and seemingly unbridgeable, gap between the two leaders on the issue.	0
41nyt17	0	a	Mr. Romney has, over the years, made it clear that his opposition to same-sex marriage and civil unions is a deeply held moral conviction, and he has not shied from using strong language to describe the offense he has taken to its introduction.	0
41nyt12	0	a	“Benefits of that nature may well be appropriate, and states are able to make a provision for the determination of those kinds of rights,” Mr. Romney said Wednesday.	0

41nyt1	0	a	Now that President Obama, long a supporter of civil unions, has publicly embraced same-sex marriage, the question of precisely what legal status and protections should be granted to gay couples is emerging as an issue of the starkest possible contrast between the two presidential candidates.	0
41fox0	0	a	"Following President Obama's comments in a TV interview expressing his support for same-sex marriage, his likely GOP rival Mitt Romney said Wednedsay he maintains his opposition to it -- the same position he's had since he ""started running for office"""	0

41hpo8	0	a	Romney's comments were far more measured than some other Republicans, who have openly accused the president of disrespecting religion and using the issue for political gain.	0
41nyt20	0	a	Democrats contend that, like Mr. Obama’s views, Mr. Romney’s feelings about gay rights have evolved, but in the opposite direction: During his campaign for the Senate in 1994, Mr. Romney vowed to seek “full equality” for gays and lesbians, in a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans of Massachusetts.	0
41nyt2	0	a	In short, both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have adopted the favored position of their ideological base on a subject that profoundly animates both of those camps.	0

39nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee’s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber.	0
39nyt35	0	a	One strain of criticism came from human rights and civil liberties activists, who expressed alarm over Judge Gorsuch’s experiences as a Justice Department official in the Bush administration in 2005 and 2006, when he helped to defend and advance the executive branch’s positions on matters like detainee treatment and surveillance.	0

39hpo9	0	a	The Democrats’ argument was instead directed at both their base and their caucus to provide a clear rationale for opposing the nominee ― no matter his qualifications.	0
39nyt15	0	a	On Thursday, representatives of the American Bar Association told the committee that it had unanimously found Judge Gorsuch to be “well qualified,” the group’s highest rating.	0
39fox2	0	a	“We will do what is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, yes,” he told Fox News’ Shannon Bream on “America’s Newsroom,” when asked if they’d go that route.	0

39hpo6	0	a	At the base of this argument was a simple question that has been dogging Democrats ever since the infamous Bush v. Gore decision on the 2000 presidential election: Is the Supreme Court rigged to benefit corporations, the wealthy and, well, Republicans?	0

39hpo8	0	a	The polished Gorsuch certainly did not make any deluded or deranged statements, as many have come to expect from the president, that could lead a Republican to flip on his nomination.	0
39nyt36	0	a	Jameel Jaffer, who litigated national-security cases against the government as the former deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, urged the committee to scrutinize more closely Judge Gorsuch’s views on executive power and individual rights.	0
39hpo22	0	a	Gorsuch’s nomination represents the fruit of the Republicans’ decision to block Garland.	0
39hpo10	0	a	Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made this point abundantly clear when he pointed to the series of 5-4 decisions made under Roberts’ leadership that have changed laws to help Republicans get elected, big donors gain more influence in politics through campaign contributions and corporations gain more economic and political power.	0
39nyt31	0	a	Even before Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, Ms. McCaskill inadvertently drew the ire of liberal activists by expressing support for “a full confirmation hearing process and a vote,” before making clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold.	0
39hpo24	1	a	“Some likened it to the action of the tyrannical kings who claim that they have sole control, as one of our senators referred to here a few minutes ago.”	1
39fox17	0	a	“If Judge Gorsuch can’t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked on Tuesday.	0
39nyt5	0	a	Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster — a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions.	0
39fox13	0	a	If majority Republicans change the threshold, Gorsuch could be approved with a simple majority of 51 votes.	0
39hpo35	0	a	The five vote conservative majority that included Scalia has sided with corporations and corporate lobby groups more than any other Supreme Court majority in recent history.	0
39hpo36	0	a	After Gorsuch repeatedly stated that there was ample room for Congress to legislate without worrying about court decisions, Democrats reminded him of how the court’s decisions play a key role in shaping who is elected to Congress and, therefore, what bills can be passed in the first place.	0
39fox15	0	a	“If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'” Trump said Feb. 1.	0

39fox22	0	a	Supreme Court justices have faced more pushback from the opposition party in recent years.	0
39nyt16	0	a	That was particularly notable in light of studies that have shown the group has tended to favor the nominees of Democratic presidents.	0
39nyt33	1	a	Two of Judge Gorsuch’s former colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver — Deanell Reece Tacha, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and Robert Harlan Henry, appointed by President Bill Clinton — praised his intellect and temperament.	1
39fox18	0	a	“If they don’t find Gorsuch acceptable, are they taking the position the vacancy should never be filled? At all?”	0
39hpo29	0	a	Instead, he went on to anchor the five vote conservative majority’s decisions in controversial cases.	0
39hpo28	0	a	In addition, Democrats are still irritated at Roberts for promising to call only “balls and strikes” in his 2005 confirmation hearing.	0
39hpo42	0	a	Schumer added that he believed he had the 41 votes necessary to filibuster the nomination.	0
39fox23	0	a	Antonin Scalia – whom Gorsuch would replace on the court following Scalia’s death in 2016 – was confirmed 98-0 and Anthony Kennedy had a tally of 97-0 in 1988.	0
39hpo40	0	a	Democrats on the committee appeared frustrated that Gorsuch refused to acknowledge the court’s role in transforming both the political and economic worlds the country’s citizens operate in.	0
39nyt20	0	a	Four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and Republican senators were blockading Mr. Obama’s appeals court and executive branch nominees, Democrats changed the chamber’s rules to bar filibusters for such positions — but left the filibuster rule in place for Supreme Court nominations.	0

39nyt12	0	a	On Thursday, Mr. McConnell accused Democrats of engaging in “obstructionist tactics” to block a well-qualified nominee.	0
39fox11	0	a	That's a high bar for Republicans, who have just 52 members in the Senate.	0
39hpo2	0	a	The four days of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings held this past week for President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat, Judge Neil Gorsuch, were different.	0
39nyt18	1	a	The group had also given its highest rating to Judge Garland.	1
39nyt24	0	a	The question facing Democrats is whether to have a filibuster fight over Judge Gorsuch, highlighting what they consider the theft of a seat they believe Mr. Obama had a right to fill, or whether to save that attention-grabbing tactic for a hypothetical future vacancy if a more liberal justice dies or steps down and President Trump nominates a staunch conservative who would shift the court’s balance.	0
39nyt22	0	a	To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change.	0

39fox14	0	a	The nuclear option was first used by Democrats for circuit court judicial appointments in 2013 and top Republicans – including President Trump – have indicated for weeks it’s a serious option in order to get Gorsuch on the court.	0
39hpo14	0	a	On this week’s episode of The Huffington Post’s “So That Happened” podcast, 2016 Democratic House candidate Zephyr Teachout, a constitutional law professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the Democrats took the right approach by aiming their fire at the court as an institution that shapes our economy and our politics.	0
39hpo34	0	a	The Roberts Court has done much to reshape power in the United States.	0

36fox4	1	a	He said the committee learned she had “unilaterally decided” to wipe it clean and permanently delete all emails.	1
36nyt5	0	a	In October, the State Department asked former secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide it with any government records — like emails — they might have in their possession.	0
36nyt12	0	a	But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting.	0
36nyt22	0	a	“I mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,” Mr. Priebus said on “Fox and Friends.”	0
36nyt3	0	a	The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department’s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.	0
36nyt19	0	a	But the time frame in which he is asking Mrs. Clinton to submit to questioning — at any time before May 1 — coincides with the period in which she is widely expected to make her candidacy official.	0

36nyt15	0	a	“To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.”	0
36fox11	0	a	He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.	0

36nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.	0
36hpo4	0	a	An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate’s privacy and security for sensitive information.	0
36nyt8	1	a	Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.	1
36nyt7	0	a	Then, he said, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months.	0
36fox6	0	a	Earlier this month, Clinton acknowledged that she sent or received roughly 60,000 related emails, turning over roughly half to the State Department and deleting about the same number of “personal” ones.	0
36fox5	0	a	“This committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy wrote to Clinton attorney David Kendall on Tuesday.	0
36nyt9	0	a	At a news conference at the United Nations a little more than a week after The Times’s report, Mrs. Clinton first said she “chose not to keep” her private personal emails.	0
36nyt26	1	a	“As far as I know, he’s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,” Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus.	1
36hpo11	1	a	Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she “thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.”	1
36nyt24	0	a	“There are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.”	0
36nyt11	0	a	Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that “a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.”	0
36fox2	0	a	"Gowdy asked that Clinton agree to a ""transcribed"" interview -- and repeated a March 16 request for her to surrender her server so it can be examined by the State Department’s inspector general."	0
36nyt23	1	a	“Even Nixon didn’t destroy the tapes,” Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation.	1

36fox8	0	a	“The committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,” Gowdy also wrote in the letter.	0
36nyt4	0	a	But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.	0
36hpo3	0	a	Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.	0
36fox10	0	a	"""I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,” he said on Fox News' ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."""	0
36hpo6	0	a	Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean.	0
36nyt6	0	a	The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clinton’s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private.	0
36nyt20	0	a	Some Republicans on Capitol Hill — including Mr. Gowdy — are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue.	0
36hpo9	0	a	“What the Committee cannot do is conclude its work without assurances the Committee has all relevant information necessary for us to discharge the duties required of us.”	0
36hpo7	0	a	Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.	0
36hpo5	0	a	The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state.	0
36nyt10	0	a	But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “will remain private.”	0
36nyt27	1	a	“And I’m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.”	1
36hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi sent a formal interview request to Hillary Clinton’s lawyer on Tuesday regarding emails she exchanged during her time as secretary of state.	0
36fox9	0	a	"Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have ""separate conversations"" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server."	0
36nyt17	0	a	“Rather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,” he said.	0
36hpo2	0	a	“Toward that end and because of the Secretary’s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy stated in the letter.	0
36nyt2	0	a	He added that Mrs. Clinton’s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted “only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.”	0
36nyt16	0	a	The committee’s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview.	0
36fox7	0	a	The South Carolina Republican set a deadline of May 1 for the interview and restated the committee is interested only in the deleted emails relating to Clinton’s response as secretary of state to the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed.	0
36fox0	0	a	"The congressional committee probing the Benghazi attacks has formally requested that Hillary Clinton appear for an interview on her use of a personal email and server for official business while secretary of state, after learning the server had been wiped ""clean."""	0

36nyt29	0	a	“We should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.”	0
36hpo14	0	a	Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said he used a private email during his time in office, as did Jeb Bush when he served as governor of Florida.	0
36hpo1	0	a	In a letter to the Clinton’s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to “Libya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.”	0
36hpo8	0	a	“We share the Secretary’s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary’s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,” Gowdy said.	0
36fox1	0	a	Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer.	0
36hpo10	1	a	Gowdy went on to call Clinton’s email situation “highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” and said it “exacerbates” lawmakers’ needs to “understand what the Secretary did.”	1

62nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an “internal government computer system” designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009.	0

17hpo9	0	a	Wisconsin GOP Chairman Reince Preibus, recently resigned RNC political director Gentry Collins, former U.S. ambassador Ann Wagner and former Michigan GOP chairman Saul Anuzis also round out the list.	0
17nyt2	0	a	Mr. Steele has lost the backing of many top supporters, but he has not yet said whether he will try to rebuild his frayed coalition and fight for the chance to lead the party into the 2012 election cycle.	0
17nyt13	0	a	The contenders for the position include: Reince Preibus, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party; Ann Wagner of Missouri, an ambassador to Luxembourg in the Bush administration; Maria Cino, a veteran Republican operative who has the support of former Vice President Dick Cheney; Saul Anuzis, former Republican chairman in Michigan; and Gentry Collins, who resigned last month as political director.	0
17nyt11	0	a	Mr. Steele, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, was elected in January 2009 to lead Republicans at a bleak moment.	0
17nyt1	0	a	Mr. Steele is expected to disclose his intentions during a conference call with committee members on Monday evening.	0
17hpo8	0	a	Maria Cino, a former Bush official who recently received key backing from former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie and former Vice President Dick Cheney, became the latest official contender this weekend.	0
17nyt3	1	a	Mr. Steele’s tenure has been one of the few blemishes this year for the Republican Party, which scored historic victories in the midterm elections.	1
17nyt9	0	a	A coordinated effort to replace Mr. Steele has been underway for weeks, with several leading Republicans arguing that the committee needed to urgently improve its fund-raising practices and tighten its organizational structure to prepare for the presidential election.	0
17fox5	0	a	Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House, narrowed the gap in the Senate and picked up 19 state legislative bodies in the November midtem election, but pressure has been mounting all year for Steele to step down from the position.	0
17fox1	0	a	A handful of well-placed and influential RNC insiders tell Fox News they expect Steele to announce he is not running for re-election.	0
17nyt15	0	a	The 168-member committee will elect a chairman during its meeting in January.	0
17nyt14	0	a	A former party chairman, Mike Duncan, also is considering a run.	0
17hpo3	1	a	And while many predict that Steele will call it quits after his current term, his increasing seclusion and detachment from other Republican advisers has made his forthcoming decision difficult to ascertain.	1
17nyt4	0	a	At least six top Republicans have already taken steps to run for party chairman and several members have withdrawn their support for Mr. Steele, leading many party leaders to conclude that Mr. Steele will not seek reelection.	0
17hpo4	0	a	At least one GOP insider who had direct contact with Steele told the Washington Post that the chairman would indeed be seeking another term atop the RNC.	0
17fox4	0	a	"In the note, he asked members to join him ""for a private conference call"" Monday evening."	0
17nyt0	0	a	The battle for control of the Republican National Committee will take a new turn on Monday when Michael Steele announces whether he plans to step down as party chairman or will disregard the onslaught of criticism about his oversight of the committee and seek a second term.	0
17fox0	0	a	Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele will speak with RNC members Monday evening in which he is expected to announce a decision about whether to make another run for the party chairmanship.	0
17hpo7	0	a	While some, such as black conservative group BOND Action, have directly announced their intentions to work toward insuring Steele's termination at the committee, other Republicans have simply lined up behind his growing list of challengers.	0
17nyt6	0	a	A spokesman for the R.N.C. did not respond to inquiries about the conference call, which Mr. Steele announced personally in a weekend e-mail message to fellow Republicans.	0
17hpo2	0	a	Meanwhile, multiple sources tell Fox News that they believe Steele will drop out of the race.	0
17nyt12	0	a	He has argued that he deserves credit for building the party in all corners of the country and winning control of the House of Representatives last month.	0
17nyt8	0	a	“Thank you and I look forward to talking to you Monday evening.”	0
17fox7	0	a	The criticism has resulted in an array of challenges or potential challenges for Steele's job from Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus, former RNC Co-Chairwoman Ann Wagner, longtime Republican official Maria Cino, former Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis and former RNC Political Director Gentry Collins.	0
17fox3	0	a	"Fox News confirmed Steele sent an e-mail to committee members Saturday night with the subject line, ""conference call."""	0
17nyt7	0	a	“Dear Members, Please join me for a private conference call,” Mr. Steele wrote in a message to Republicans, which was provided to the New York Times by a committee member.	0
17hpo1	0	a	"Politico reported over the weekend that many of his supporters as well as other GOP operatives believe that a Steele run was looking increasingly doubtful, due in part to the fact that he ""has built no known reelection team or structure, making the prospect of a campaign unlikely in the face of competition that grows fiercer by the day."""	0
17hpo10	0	a	Politico also reports that former Senator Norm Coleman could enter the race if Steele decides not to run.	0
17nyt10	0	a	The political director of the committee resigned in protest last month and is among those vying for the job.	0
17hpo0	0	a	RNC Chairman Michael Steele is expected by some to announce that he will not seek a second term as the head of the Republican National Committee, according to multiple reports.	0
17hpo5	0	a	"Hotline On Call says the nature of the decision is a ""closely guarded secret"" and reports that ""even his top advisors, both inside and outside the committee, say they don't know which direction he will take."""	0
17nyt5	0	a	But Mr. Steele has kept close counsel about his future, Republican officials said Sunday, and his plans were unknown even to several of his own advisers.	0
17fox2	1	a	But Steele has been unpredictable, especially over recent weeks, and some close to the GOP chairman say he wants to run for another term and is struggling to find enough support for a second term.	1
17fox6	1	a	Critics have described the chairman as gaffe-prone and said he hasn't raised enough money.	1
79hpo26	0	a	“Let me be as clear as I can be,” Sanders said in a statement.	0
79hpo49	0	a	During a bipartisan briefing on Capitol Hill later Wednesday, lawmakers discussed the possibility of allowing members of Congress to use campaign funds to bolster security at their private residences.	0
79nyt44	0	a	Doctors said his condition was critical but improving.	0
79nyt20	0	a	“What’s the half-life?” asked Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, appraising how long the comity might last.	0
79nyt27	1	a	And Ms. Pelosi could not resist suggesting that Republicans were the initiators of the present rancor.	1
79hpo15	0	a	Matt Mika, director of government relations for Tyson Foods’ Washington, D.C., office, was also among those shot.	0
79nyt46	0	a	“Maybe with a little more time, the teams would be mixed,” suggested Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida.	0
79hpo47	0	a	Trump said that he was “deeply saddened” by the news.	0
79hpo51	0	a	He added that Ryan was investigating the matter alongside the Federal Election Commission.	0
79hpo28	0	a	Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who was also at the practice, told MSNBC that Scalise crawled through the dirt, bleeding, to get away from the shooter.	0
79hpo14	0	a	Williams sustained a minor leg injury.	0
79nyt6	1	a	When a video message from President Trump played on the big screen, some of the Democrats in the crowd booed, but less lustily than usual.	1
79nyt42	0	a	(The ball was delivered to the mound, in an apparent bit of sponsorship oddity, by a Budweiser Clydesdale.)	0
79hpo3	0	a	Scalise underwent surgery at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center after being shot in the hip.	0
79nyt1	0	a	A day earlier, on another ball field some seven miles southwest, a gunman had opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team, striking four people — including Steve Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives — who were there for a practice.	0
79hpo17	0	a	The attack took place shortly after 7 a.m. at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, less than 8 miles south of the White House.	0
79fox9	0	a	“We already had concerns and we have great law enforcement at home, first responders do a great job, but this makes you anticipate every event now in a new way,” Brat said on Fox News’ “America’s News HQ” on Wednesday.	0
79fox15	0	a	“We were like sitting ducks.”	0
79hpo4	0	a	In a statement Wednesday night, the hospital said Scalise sustained “a single rifle shot to the left hip” that “travelled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs and causing severe bleeding.”	0
79nyt30	0	a	It’ll be for another day.”	0
79fox25	0	a	Rogers was injured during the attack when he dove into the dugout “like a pool without water.”	0
79hpo39	0	a	Police shut down the streets for blocks around the field early Wednesday, and a helicopter was flying overhead.	0
79nyt33	0	a	Another attendee delivered this message, held aloft: “This Democrat is here to support Congressman Scalise.	0
79hpo37	0	a	The event pits Republicans against Democrats and raises funds for area nonprofits, including the Washington Literacy Center, the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington and the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation.	0
79hpo54	0	a	The FBI is taking over the investigation into the shooting, Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said.	0
79fox24	0	a	Rep. Williams backed Gingrich's comments in a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday.	0
79nyt9	0	a	Some members of Congress had not expected to stay behind for the annual showdown, with families and district business waiting for them.	0
79fox29	0	a	U.S. Capitol Police have not announced any increased security measures for congressional lawmakers, but said they will “continue to provide a robust and visible presence” around the Capitol.	0
79nyt41	0	a	David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was wounded while helping to stop the attack, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.	0
79nyt49	0	a	By the concessions, attendees discussed field director salaries and legislative wrangling.	0
79hpo20	0	a	The FBI is investigating Hodgkinson and his possible motives.	0
79nyt5	0	a	Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, wore a shirt from Louisiana State University, Mr. Scalise’s alma mater.	0
79nyt14	0	a	“I have to stay,” he said softly.	0
79nyt21	0	a	“I don’t know. I don’t know.”	0
79nyt48	0	a	Several elements of the evening did diverge sharply from the ballpark’s standard, professional fare — commonplace for a congressional game that has, since 1909, produced a steady torrent of middling baseball, worse trash talk and more than occasional injury.	0
79nyt32	0	a	House interns hauled signs: “Scalise Strong,” “Capitol Police MVP” and “Unvidvided” in red, white, and blue.	0
79hpo50	0	a	“There’s going to be a review of exactly what funds can and should be used in the event there are security concerns by any member,” said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).	0
79nyt2	0	a	And on Thursday, the capital’s various institutional forces — senators and lobbyists, staff members with a job to do and residents with an evening to spare — joined, for a moment, in a bipartisan rebuttal: Play ball.	0
79nyt39	0	a	Among those on the field before the game was Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas, whose aide Zachary Barth was shot at the practice.	0
79hpo29	0	a	Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told reporters that he used his belt as a tourniquet to stop a staffer’s bleeding.	0
79nyt59	0	a	“That can be done.”	0
79hpo27	1	a	“Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.”	1
79nyt35	0	a	Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, resolved to wear a “Team Scalise” shirt to the game.	0
79hpo19	0	a	“At that point, we were able to calm the situation, and victims were transported to the hospital,” Verderosa said.	0
79fox12	0	a	This year's town halls to date have been particularly rowdy and tense, prompting lawmaker concerns long before Wednesday's attack.	0
79hpo22	0	a	The shooter’s weapons ― a 9 mm handgun and 7.62-caliber rifle ― were recovered at the scene by law enforcement officials.	0
79fox0	0	a	Lawmakers at the scene of Wednesday’s baseball practice shooting described themselves as “sitting ducks” and said the violence would have been a “massacre” if not for Majority Whip Steve Scalise's detail -- spurring new questions over whether congressional security practices should be overhauled.	0
79nyt61	0	a	A little before 10 p.m., the Democrats secured their final out for an 11-2 victory, taking a 40-to-39 edge in the lifetime series.	0
79nyt62	0	a	As the players shook hands, the team managers — Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas — gathered for closing ceremonies.	0
79nyt19	0	a	It had to be. Probably. Maybe. Right?	0
79hpo34	0	a	He said he heard at least 30 shots and got down on the ground, but couldn’t see the shooter.	0

79nyt23	0	a	Even one day out from the initial anguish, much of the political ecosystem seemed unchanged.	0
79nyt8	0	a	“The game will go on.”	0
79hpo31	0	a	Paul told CNN that “nobody would’ve survived” had Capitol Police not been there.	0
79nyt63	0	a	Mr. Doyle did not hold the trophy for long.	0
79hpo21	0	a	It’s too early to determine whether the attack was politically motivated, authorities said.	0
79hpo8	0	a	President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump on Wednesday night visited Scalise in the hospital, bringing flowers and offering support to the lawmaker’s family.	0
79hpo41	0	a	No members or staff were harmed in the shooting, but the building sustained bullet damage.	0
79fox3	0	a	"The Congressman will require additional operations, and will be in the hospital for some time."""	0
79nyt54	0	a	“We’re just one day removed, so it still feels different, I think,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said before the game, recalling past tragedies that many swore would reshape the nation’s politics.	0
79fox5	0	a	His detail was credited with putting down the attacker and saving lives.	0
79nyt40	0	a	Mr. Williams, a coach on the team, trudged out on crutches after injuring his foot in the Wednesday morning fray as well.	0
79hpo46	0	a	Lawmakers from both parties expressed sympathy for the victims.	0
79fox21	0	a	"He said the threat of the ""occasional deranged person"" should not change that."	0
79nyt56	0	a	At the practice on Wednesday, Mr. Flake had raced to Mr. Scalise’s side to provide water and first aid after the shooting stopped.	0
79nyt55	0	a	“I hope it lasts.”	0
79nyt36	0	a	Ms. Pelosi sat for an interview alongside Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.	0

79hpo30	0	a	Paul said that a number of aides were lying down during the attack as the shooter fired bullets their way.	0
79hpo18	0	a	U.S. Capitol Police officers assigned to Scalise engaged Hodgkinson in gunfire, and Alexandria Police responded soon after.	0
79hpo45	0	a	She said that while he appears to have visited the facility “frequently and at all hours of the day,” staff received “no complaints” about his behavior.	0
79hpo43	0	a	“They’re just grateful everyone was able to work together as a team and get out.”	0
79nyt29	0	a	Moments later, she added, a bit regretfully: “I really am almost sad for myself that I have gone down this path with you, because I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it.	0
79nyt3	0	a	Beneath a mostly cloudless sky, at least by the mid-innings, fans in the stands intermingled red and blue.	0
79hpo40	0	a	A lockdown has been lifted at the YMCA Alexandria, next to the field where the shooting took place, spokeswoman Dana Rucker told HuffPost.	0
79hpo35	0	a	“There’s no place I could go,” he said.	0
79nyt13	0	a	Mr. Lewis, now 77, stared straight ahead for a moment.	0
79nyt10	0	a	But by nightfall, the decision was clear.	0
79nyt22	0	a	The skepticism is near-universal.	0
79nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The lawmakers trotted from their dugouts at Nationals Park, together in a near-summer air that never quite felt swampy, united in a certainty that the game must go on, just not exactly as it had before.	0
79fox13	0	a	The Wednesday attack injured Scalise; Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods; Zack Barth, a staffer from Texas Rep. Roger Williams’ office; and two U.S. Capitol Police officers, Special Agents Crystal Griner and David Bailey.	0
79fox2	0	a	He remains in critical condition, but has improved in the last 24 hours.	0
79nyt45	0	a	He received a standing ovation when he was introduced as a team member, with Democrats waving their caps at his image on the screen beyond the outfield fence.	0
79fox20	0	a	Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich lauded the current system where lawmakers interact with the people on a regular basis in settings like grocery stores.	0
79nyt53	0	a	Supporters from both parties raised hot dogs and beers, catching up on acquaintances in common.	0
79nyt38	1	a	“We don’t dislike each other,” Mr. McConnell said, deploying a rare complimentary double negative.	1
79hpo2	0	a	The assailant, who authorities have identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, was shot by police and later died of his injuries at a hospital.	0
79fox6	1	a	"“If Scalise was not there, he’s the one with security detail, we wouldn’t have had any protection and God knows how bad that might have been,” Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told ""Fox & Friends."""	1
79nyt4	0	a	Near the dugout, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump bantered with Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat, who chatted with two of her young children.	0
79nyt31	0	a	But for an optimist in the city — and there still seem to be a few — there were flourishes to appreciate.	0
79nyt51	0	a	A cutout of the head of Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, was held high.	0
79nyt28	0	a	“Somewhere in the ’90s, Republicans decided on a politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons,” she told reporters earlier on Thursday.	0
79fox33	0	a	“But there are a lot of bad actors out there looking to do harm, and vigilance needs to be taken by each member and their staff.”	0
79hpo16	0	a	His condition was upgraded from “critical” to “serious” on Thursday, a spokeswoman for George Washington University Hospital confirmed to HuffPost.	0
79hpo5	0	a	“He underwent immediate surgery and an additional procedure to stop bleeding,” the hospital said, noting the congressman had received multiple blood transfusions and remained in critical condition late Wednesday.	0
79fox17	0	a	A detail for every lawmaker is likely not possible -- and security already is provided for major events and lawmakers facing a specific threat.	0
79nyt64	0	a	It was going to Mr. Scalise’s office, they decided, until he gets back.	0
79fox32	0	a	“You have to consider that there is a lot of information for the public—obviously members want to give as much information as they can—a lot of calendars are broadcast, social media, information is readily available,” Norton said.	0
79nyt16	0	a	At work on Thursday, those pangs visited lawmakers like a too-familiar houseguest — stalking them down the Capitol’s corridors, past the Senate chamber where a ferocious health care debate had already resumed, along the hall where some had stood one day earlier as survivors, still in dusted cleats and uniforms, unharmed but unsettled.	0
79hpo1	0	a	Six people, including two congressmen, two police officers, a congressional aide and a lobbyist, were injured in the attack in an Alexandria, Virginia, park.	0
79nyt57	0	a	He set out a goal for himself and his colleagues, uttered before inside the Capitol.	0
79hpo9	0	a	The Trumps also met with Crystal Griner, one of the two U.S. Capitol Police officers injured in the attack, and her wife.	0
79hpo7	0	a	Before the surgery, Scalise was “in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,” his office said.	0
79fox10	0	a	“Forty guys get together at the same time, that would be a major security event normally, but I think we got a little excited and didn’t think things through as well as we could have.”	0
79hpo12	0	a	Zachary Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas), was shot in the leg.	0
79nyt15	0	a	All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol.	0
79hpo52	0	a	“We’re looking at that,” Hoyer said.	0
79hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ―House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was still in critical condition on Thursday after a lone gunman opened fire Wednesday morning on a group of Republican lawmakers practicing for a congressional baseball game.	0
79nyt47	0	a	“But at least for now, the healthy competition will bring us together.”	0
79nyt60	0	a	For an evening, at least, Washington delivered.	0
79hpo48	0	a	“Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected,” he said in a statement.	0
79nyt18	0	a	More sustainable.	0
79fox19	0	a	“I bet most members of Congress would say they don’t want [a] security detail—I sure don’t,” Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., manager of the Democratic congressional baseball team, told reporters.	0
79fox31	0	a	But he said they need to consider “the dangers” that come with public forums.	0
79hpo10	0	a	Griner and David Bailey, the other officer hurt, are in stable condition, according to Chief Matthew R. Verderosa.	0
79fox28	0	a	Rep. Thomas Massie, R-K.Y., took calls for additional security a step further on Thursday by re-introducing legislation that would allow those who have concealed carry permits in their home states to carry in Washington D.C.	0
79hpo55	0	a	Jay Roberts, 60, lives nearby and said the game was “probably one of the few moments with all this rancor and politics that they can have some normalcy.”	0
79nyt34	0	a	Get well soon, sir.”	0
79fox8	0	a	He, along with several other members of Congress, suggested the most critical change may be to boost security for large lawmaker gatherings, even informal ones like the baseball practice in Alexandria, Va.	0
79nyt12	0	a	He spoke of 1968 and of the political violence he had seen up close as a civil rights leader, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.	0
79fox16	0	a	Lawmakers have appealed for more security before, including after the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.	0
79fox11	0	a	Brat said lawmakers “may need to recalibrate public events,” while also suggesting “tighter security” at town halls -- which most congressional lawmakers have scheduled through the summer recess.	0
79fox23	0	a	Gingrich added: “We are a free country, and we’re gonna run the risk of freedom.”	0
79nyt17	0	a	The reaction would be different this time, some said.	0
79fox4	0	a	Scalise, R-La., like other members of leadership, is assigned a full-time security detail from U.S. Capitol Police, who guard him in Washington and at home in his district.	0
79fox22	0	a	“We start surrounding these folks with layers of guards—it will really cripple the ability to be a free society,” he said on “Outnumbered.”	0
79nyt37	0	a	The Senate leaders — Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer of New York — did the same.	0
79nyt7	0	a	“You are showing the world that we will not be intimidated,” Mr. Trump said.	0
79nyt52	0	a	Chants of “We love you, Pelosi!” rang out briefly, until the minority leader acknowledged them.	0
79hpo44	0	a	Hodgkinson was member of the YMCA, Rucker said in a statement.	0
79nyt26	1	a	Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he was warming up with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who is not known for bipartisan spirit.	1
79hpo13	0	a	He was transported to a local hospital and has since been released.	0
79hpo32	0	a	“It would’ve been a massacre without them,” he said.	0
79nyt11	0	a	“We come here, and these members become our family,” Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said at the Capitol before a game he had not intended to see.	0
79hpo33	0	a	Noah Nathan, 47, lives in a nearby apartment building and was at the dog park when the shooting took place.	0
79hpo56	0	a	“I imagined it would be something fun to watch, you know, because evidently it’s partisan politics are put aside, let’s have a softball game, let’s have some fun,” he said.	0
79hpo24	0	a	The FBI said it was processing a cell phone, a computer and a camera recovered from Hodgkinson’s van, which was in the parking lot of a YMCA adjacent to the park.	0
79nyt25	0	a	Elected officials accused one another of hypocrisy and selective memory on matters of policy, perhaps a bit more gently than they might have on a typical weekday.	0
79fox1	0	a	"Thursday night, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center issued a statement saying Scalise ""underwent a second surgery related to his internal injuries and a broken bone in his leg."	0
79nyt58	0	a	“Tone down our own rhetoric and not ascribe the worst motives to our colleagues,” he said hopefully.	0
79fox18	0	a	But there are broad questions at hand in boosting security beyond that: particularly, does it hurt democracy to put an added barrier between lawmakers and constituents?	0
79fox14	0	a	"“Without Capitol Hill police, it would have been a massacre—we had no defense—we had no defense at all,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on ""Fox & Friends."""	0
79hpo53	0	a	Many previously scheduled events around Capitol Hill were canceled Wednesday, including an event Trump was scheduled to attend at the Department of Labor.	0
79nyt24	1	a	In a Thursday morning tweet, Mr. Trump railed against the “WITCH HUNT” of investigations of his associates.	1
79hpo42	0	a	“They are shaken,” Rucker said of YMCA staff.	0
79fox26	0	a	But Williams suggested he would feel “safer” if he were allowed to carry a gun on Capitol Hill, reminding reporters that he’s “a big Second Amendment guy” -- and said “we probably ought to take a look at our security in big groups like that.”	0
79fox7	0	a	Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., acknowledged the incident has sparked new security questions for members without assigned police protection at events outside Capitol Hill.	0

78nyt21	0	a	At 6:20 p.m., the spokesman for the National Security Council at the time, Tommy Vietor, e-mailed to remind officials that Denis McDonough, then the deputy national security adviser and now the White House chief of staff, wanted to ensure that the edits were coordinated with the State Department.	0

78nyt8	0	a	The e-mails revealed no new details about the administration’s evolving account of the Sept. 11 attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.	0
78hpo7	1	a	Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism.	1

78nyt19	0	a	The release of the e-mails offers a rare glimpse inside the White House five days after the attack as it struggled to piece together intelligence to formulate a public account of what happened.	0
78hpo19	0	a	A reference to another terrorist group, Ansar al-Sharia, was left in, but later removed at the request of the State Department; the CIA agreed with that decision, again so as not to hinder the FBI investigation.	0

78nyt2	1	a	Mr. Morell, administration officials said, deleted a reference in the draft version of the talking points to C.I.A. warnings of extremist threats in Libya, which State Department officials objected to because they feared it would reflect badly on them.	1

78nyt16	1	a	It drew attention to a draft of the talking points — the only document provided by the White House that was not part of an e-mail chain — in which Mr. Morell, in his own writing, crossed out five lines that referred to C.I.A. warnings about the threat of attacks by Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Benghazi and eastern Libya.	1
78fox11	0	a	During congressional hearings in January, Clinton was asked whether she had seen the cable by Republican Rep. Michael McCaul.	0
78hpo2	0	a	In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.	0
78nyt35	1	a	Asked by one of Ms. Rice’s aides, “Is this the final language you want to use on Benghazi,” Mr. Rhodes replied with a single word: “Yup.”	1
78fox16	0	a	After the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed he knew about the cable which summarized the August emergency meeting in Benghazi, Graham questioned why the military was read in when Clinton apparently was not.	0
78fox4	0	a	A review of now-public State Department records as well as a classified State Department cable, first reviewed and reported by Fox News, shows a steady stream of documented warnings to Washington from intelligence and State security officials on the ground in Libya that the Islamist threat was severe and growing.	0
78nyt29	0	a	In a report that set off the latest tempest over the talking points, ABC News reported incorrectly that Mr. Rhodes had emphasized the need to protect the State Department’s interests.	0
78nyt24	0	a	At 7:16 p.m., Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, weighed in with her initial concerns about ensuring that the talking points provided to lawmakers did not go further than what the administration was telling reporters.	0
78fox5	0	a	One of the most significant warnings was an August 2012 State Department classified cable, which has not been made public, that summarized an emergency meeting in Benghazi where the CIA briefed on the significant threat of terrorist activity.	0
78nyt9	0	a	“In recent days, these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media,” said a White House spokesman, Eric Schultz.	0
78fox15	0	a	In February, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham followed up on the classified cable.	0
78nyt22	0	a	At 6:41 p.m., Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the director of national intelligence, suggested saying that on Sept. 10, the C.I.A. had “notified” the American embassy in Cairo, not “warned” it, of social media reports calling for a demonstration and encouraging jihadists to break into the embassy.	0
78nyt13	1	a	They also said the e-mails belied the White House’s insistence that it had changed only one word in the talking points.	1
78fox1	0	a	"Draft ""talking points"" obtained by The Weekly Standard and ABC News depicted efforts by State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in the days after the attack to strip out references to prior attacks in Benghazi."	0

78hpo28	0	a	UPDATE: 9 p.m. -- White House spokesman Eric Schultz said he hoped Wednesday's disclosure would put to rest the Benghazi issue.	0
78fox13	0	a	"""Congressman, that cable did not come to my attention,"" Clinton testified before the House Foreign Affairs committee."	0
78nyt17	1	a	But there is no other evidence in the e-mails that Mr. Morell himself objected to the inclusion of this material.	1
78hpo22	0	a	If the material was too sensitive to share publicly months, weeks or days ago, what changed on Wednesday?	0
78nyt11	0	a	Still, the final version of the talking points is stripped of material — including a reference to Libya being awash with weapons and fighters that made it a dangerous environment — which critics say would have raised questions about the State Department’s security posture.	0
78nyt5	1	a	“This is certainly not what Vice Chairman Ruppersberger was hoping to get,” Mr. Petraeus wrote, referring to Representative C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which had asked Mr. Petraeus for talking points to use with reporters in discussing the attack on Benghazi.	1
78hpo16	0	a	Their concerns at other times were more mundane.	0
78nyt3	0	a	Mr. Morell, officials said, acted on his own and not in response to pressure from the State Department.	0
78nyt7	0	a	While the e-mails portrayed White House officials as being sensitive to the concerns of the State Department, they suggest that Mr. Obama’s aides mostly mediated a bureaucratic tug of war between the State Department and the C.I.A. over how much to disclose — all under heavy time constraints because of the demands from Capitol Hill.	0
78hpo15	0	a	"Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government ""know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,"" because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks."	0
78hpo11	1	a	Morell believed it was irrelevant to the message of the talking points -- what happened in Benghazi -- and unprofessional to include those warnings but not allow State Department officials to include how they had responded to them.	1
78hpo5	0	a	In particular, they pointed to the fact that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed.	0
78hpo20	0	a	The timing of the White House's document release raises its own set of questions.	0

78nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — E-mails released by the White House on Wednesday revealed a fierce internal jostling over the government’s official talking points in the aftermath of last September’s attack in Benghazi, Libya, not only between the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, but at the highest levels of the C.I.A.	0
78hpo29	0	a	“Despite the fact that e-mails relating to the Benghazi talking points were made available to members of Congress several months ago, in recent days these e-mails have been selectively and inaccurately read out to the media.	0
78fox20	0	a	In addition to attacks in Benghazi on the British ambassador -- which forced the temporary closure of the U.K. operation -- the International Red Cross and United Nations, in the summer of 2012 the group Ansar al-Sharia was so well-established it held an annual conference in Benghazi to promote Islamic law.	0
78nyt31	0	a	Mr. Obama’s national security deputies reviewed the talking points at a meeting the next day, Sept. 15, Mr. Rhodes said.	0
78nyt30	0	a	At 9:52 p.m., a C.I.A. spokesman e-mailed to other agency staff members a draft note intended for Mr. Petraeus, warning him that while the White House had quickly cleared the proposed talking points, the State Department had “major concerns.”	0
78fox24	1	a	"The State Department, in a document put out last week, noted that while an internal review found certain senior officials ""demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability"" in response to security concerns, there was no specific finding of misconduct."	1
78nyt28	0	a	Ten minutes later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, offered his first comments, saying, “We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, especially the investigation.”	0

78nyt26	0	a	At 7:51 p.m., the F.B.I. offered only minor changes to the draft, the bureau’s only suggestions during the contentious process.	0
78nyt4	1	a	But when the final draft of the talking points was sent to Mr. Petraeus, he dismissed them, saying “Frankly, I’d just as soon not use this,” adding that the heavily scrubbed account would not satisfy the House Democrat who had requested it.	1

78hpo12	0	a	Separate from Wednesday's document release, the CIA recently conducted an internal review of how and why the talking points were changed -- a move that also came in response to the continuing questions from Congress.	0

77nyt6	0	a	Mr. Trump’s victory traces back to June, when Mr. Strzok’s conduct was laid out in a wide-ranging inspector general’s report on how the F.B.I. handled the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails in the run-up to the 2016 election. 	0
77hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ― FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, who was taken off special counsel Robert Mueller’s team after Justice Department investigators discovered his texts disparaging President Donald Trump, has been fired from the bureau despite the recommendations of a career FBI official.	0
77hpo8	0	a	He testified last month after the release of an inspector general report on the handling of the FBI’s Hillary Clinton probe that described anti-Trump texts exchanged by bureau officials.	0
77nyt25	0	a	Mr. Strzok became emblematic of Mr. Trump’s unfounded assertions that a so-called deep state of bureaucrats opposed to him was undermining his presidency. 	0
77hpo17	0	a	Trump celebrated Strzok’s firing on Twitter, writing Monday that the investigation into his campaign “should be dropped” and that the investigation into Clinton “should be properly redone.”	0

77fox21	0	a	"One Strzok text in particular vowed to ""stop"" Trump from becoming president. "	0
77fox30	0	a	Strzok’s attorney, meanwhile, blasted the bureau on Monday, saying the deputy director “reversed the decision of the career FBI official responsible for employee discipline who concluded, through an independent review process, that a 60-day suspension and demotion from supervisory duties was the appropriate punishment.”	0
77nyt39	0	a	The inspector general said the email, which included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, contained information that appeared to be under seal.	0
77nyt11	0	a	Firing Mr. Strzok, however, removes a favorite target of Mr. Trump from the ranks of the F.B.I. and gives Mr. Bowdich and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, a chance to move beyond the president’s ire.	0
77hpo13	0	a	But DOJ’s inspector general was “deeply troubled” by texts Strzok sent that “potentially indicated or created the appearance that the investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” and particularly focused on one anti-Trump text that implied a willingness “to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.”	0
77nyt38	0	a	In addition, the inspector general said that Mr. Strzok had forwarded a proposed search warrant to his personal email account. 	0

77nyt43	0	a	He is the second senior F.B.I. agent to be fired as a result of the inspector general’s investigation. 	0
77nyt9	0	a	But Mr. Strzok’s lawyer said the deputy director of the F.B.I., David Bowdich, had overruled the Office of Professional Responsibility and fired Mr. Strzok.	0
77nyt21	0	a	In addition, the inspector general criticized Mr. Strzok’s decision not to move swiftly to examine new emails related to the Clinton investigation just weeks before the 2016 election.	0

8fox7	1	a	Rubio repeated his characterization of Obama as a president so concerned with softening any perception other nations has of the United States as a bully that he erred in acting in the other extreme, eager to acquiesce to foreign governments that have thumbed their noses at the U.S. and international laws.	1

8fox10	1	a	From his reset with Russia, to his open hand to Iran, to his unreciprocated opening to Cuba, he has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.”	1
8hpo8	1	a	From his seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio has already played a key role in U.S. foreign policy debates, often staking out positions that directly counter President Barack Obama's administration.	1

8nyt6	1	a	Mr. Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate Intelligence committees, has used his time in Congress to burnish his foreign policy credits and cast himself as a defense hawk: a position that could help him stand out in a crowded primary field.	1

91hpo52	0	a	"We are hoping that as the process goes on and as the debate goes on, we might come up with some other ideas."""	0
91nyt1	0	a	WASHINGTON — President Obama this week will embrace a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence that will call for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and lay out 19 separate actions the president could take by invoking the power of his office, lawmakers who were briefed on the plan said Monday.	0
91hpo1	0	a	WASHINGTON -- In a bold and potentially historic attempt to stem the increase in mass gun violence, President Barack Obama unveiled on Wednesday the most sweeping effort at gun control policy reform in a generation.	0
91fox27	0	a	Some local officials have vowed to resist federal action.	0
91hpo5	0	a	The proposal, which comes at the end of a month-long review process spearheaded by Vice President Joe Biden, is broken down into four key subsections: law enforcement, the availability of dangerous firearms and ammunition, school safety and mental health.	0
91fox35	0	a	"And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said."	0
91hpo44	0	a	The White House nevertheless insists that its package of proposals has teeth.	0
91hpo45	0	a	It would provide law enforcement with the mechanisms needed to go after the illegal transfer of weapons and help prevent those weapons from falling into the wrong hands.	0
91hpo18	0	a	But putting together ideas is the easy part.	0
91fox30	0	a	Obama has been critical of the NRA's plan to install armed security in every school.	0
91nyt4	0	a	Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort.	0
91nyt30	0	a	Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, is a longtime supporter of gun rights.	0
91hpo26	0	a	"""It can't just be the usual suspects,"" he continued."	0
91hpo29	0	a	A spokesman for the National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the president's proposal.	0
91nyt9	0	a	The administration’s strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire by White House officials to address the Connecticut shooting while also confronting the broader deficiencies in the country’s criminal justice and mental health systems.	0
91hpo37	0	a	The president's plan also calls on Congress to allocate resources to help schools, other educational institutions and houses of worship develop emergency management plans.	0
91fox7	0	a	"... Let's do the right thing."""	0
91nyt29	0	a	Scores of senators, including many Democrats, will be wary of voting on any effort to curb access to guns or ammunition.	0
91hpo30	0	a	But the organization has already harshly criticized the Obama administration for overreach.	0
91nyt26	0	a	We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.”	0
91nyt24	0	a	“The assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden task force is considering,” Matt Bennett, a spokesman for Third Way, a left-leaning research group, said after hearing from Mr. Biden last week.	0
91nyt31	0	a	Still, gun legislation is likely to begin in the Senate because the House is controlled by Republicans, many of whom oppose new restrictions on guns.	0
91hpo47	0	a	The question, in some respects, is not what's missing from the set of ideas, but what took the administration so long to get to this point.	0
91hpo21	0	a	A senior administration official said that the president's proposal shouldn't be considered finalized legislative language, but rather a series of recommendations for Congress to consider.	0
91fox29	0	a	"The group's first ad called Obama an ""elitist hypocrite"" for his daughters' security detail."	0
91fox31	0	a	The White House plan does address school security, urging Congress to help schools complete emergency plans; proposing an initiative to help schools hire up to 1,000 resource officers and mental health professionals; and proposing new training for teachers to recognize mental health issues among young people.	0
91nyt33	0	a	In coming weeks, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, will reintroduce a measure that would require every gun buyer, with limited exceptions, to undergo a background check and would force states to feed all relevant data into the background check system so those with criminal convictions and the mentally ill could be flagged.	0

91nyt27	0	a	Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous and ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration.	0
91fox2	0	a	Already facing stiff opposition from gun-rights advocates and Republican lawmakers, the president called on Congress to pass several major changes to the country's current gun laws -- some of which are already being considered like the restrictions on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.	0
91hpo48	0	a	"""It is not as though we had this whole policy paper sitting on the shelf somewhere,"" said a senior administration official."	0
91fox23	0	a	"Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said ""all options should be on the table."""	0
91hpo8	0	a	Because these recommendations require congressional approval, the administration is supplementing its proposal with 23 executive actions that will be taken immediately.	0
91nyt2	0	a	Lawmakers and other officials said that the president could use a public event as soon as Wednesday to signal his intention to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, focusing on the heightened background checks and including efforts to ban assault weapons and their high-capacity clips.	0
91nyt15	0	a	But Mr. Obama’s allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the politically charged issue for years.	0
91fox15	0	a	The most controversial elements of the president's plan, though, continue to be the proposals he wants Congress to pass.	0
91fox19	0	a	The plan was already earning a mixed response from lawmakers.	0
91nyt5	0	a	White House aides believe Mr. Obama can also ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of people who lie on their background checks.	0
91fox11	0	a	The plan, though, does call for a range of measures to improve access to mental health services and improve safety at America's schools.	0
91hpo19	0	a	Selling them on the Hill will take a bit of legislative craft.	0
91hpo51	0	a	We tried to be as comprehensive as possible.	0
91nyt6	0	a	At a news conference on Monday, exactly one month after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama said a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had “presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn’t happen again.	0
91hpo3	0	a	"This is how we will be judged,"" Obama said."	0
91fox1	0	a	President Obama called Wednesday for a new and tougher assault-weapons ban and a 10-round limit on magazines, as part of a comprehensive plan to curb gun violence that includes 23 steps he took without congressional action.	0
91hpo6	0	a	In an effort to touch on all four of those elements, the president recommended requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales; reinstating the assault weapons ban; restoring a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines; eliminating armor-piercing bullets; providing mental health services in schools; allocating funds to hire more police officers; and instituting a federal gun trafficking statute, among other policies.	0

91nyt19	0	a	Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said Vice President Biden had informed lawmakers during a two-hour briefing on Monday that there are “19 independent steps that the president can take by executive order.”	0
91nyt17	0	a	“There’s some huge, huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe.	0
91nyt13	0	a	White House officials and Democratic lawmakers said that there are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do, and that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he would need Congressional authority to accomplish.	0
91nyt25	0	a	“Political capital in the gun debate only goes so far.	0

91hpo40	0	a	Moreover, the administration is pointedly not going after those weapons and ammunition magazines that are currently and lawfully owned.	0

91nyt0	0	a	Obama Willing to Use Executive Orders on Guns	0
91hpo22	0	a	The president would be working with lawmakers to move the process forward, the official added, and would be trying to build up public opinion as well.	0
91nyt10	0	a	By proposing to use the independent power of his office, Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who have already expressed fear that he will abuse that authority to restrict their rights.	0
91hpo31	1	a	"""It is unfortunate that this administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems,"" the NRA said after meeting with Biden last week."	1

91hpo35	0	a	As part of its policy recommendations, the White House called on Congress to act on an old administration proposal to spend $4 billion to keep 15,000 cops on the streets.	0
91hpo17	0	a	"""We're ready to push this thing through."""	0
91fox8	1	a	The president was joined by four children who wrote to the White House about gun violence following the Connecticut mass shooting in which 20 children were killed.	1

91hpo13	0	a	The president on Wednesday will nominate Byron Todd Jones, the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to take over the post permanently.	0
91nyt14	0	a	On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama’s legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, and the lawmakers they support with millions of dollars at election time and who see gun rights as a defining issue in their districts.	0
91hpo14	0	a	In total, the proposal goes beyond what most gun control advocates were hoping for at the start of Biden's review process, during which he held 22 different meetings with 229 different organizations and 31 elected officials.	0
91fox20	1	a	"Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., accused Obama of trying to ""undermine Americans' constitutional right to bear arms"" without doing enough to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill."	1
91fox10	0	a	Despite discussions earlier about addressing the pervasive violence in the entertainment and video game industries, the president's plan did not address those issues in depth.	0
91hpo28	0	a	The gun-rights lobby has already signaled that it will try to block the administration's effort.	0
91nyt12	0	a	“I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary,” Mr. Stockman said in a statement.	0
91fox26	0	a	Gun-rights groups say the effort to impose more gun control measures is misguided, noting in particular that most killings in America are committed with handguns and not the assault weapons the administration intends to target.	0
91hpo39	0	a	Among the suggested recommendations on the gun-policy front, only the ban on high-capacity magazines could have had a tangible impact on the shooting in Newtown, and it's unclear what, exactly, the effect would have been.	0
91fox13	0	a	Unilaterally, Obama on Wednesday directed federal agencies to share information with the federal background check system; proposed new rules to let law enforcement run full background checks before returning a seized gun; ordered the Centers for Disease Control to research causes of gun violence; required law enforcement to trace guns from criminal investigations; and took other steps.	0
91hpo2	0	a	"""This is our first task as a society: keeping our children safe."	0
91hpo9	0	a	Those actions include requiring federal agencies to hand over relevant data for a background check system; providing law enforcement officials, first responders and school officials with better training for active shooting situations; directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence; and many more.	0
91nyt21	0	a	Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama’s former chief of staff, joined the debate on Monday and said that the president should “clear the table” by doing whatever he can administratively so small issues do not get in the way of the bigger legislative fights over access to guns.	0

91fox33	0	a	House Speaker John Boehner declined to weigh in on the merits of the president's proposals Wednesday.	0
91nyt23	0	a	While many gun control advocates are eager to harness what they believe is a ripe moment in American life for new and robust restrictions on the kinds of guns that were used in Newtown, there is an emerging consensus on Capitol Hill and among gun education groups that improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable legislative route to pursue.	0
91fox28	0	a	The National Rifle Association also plans to launch a major ad campaign.	0
91fox24	0	a	"Texas Gov. Rick Perry, in a written statement, said: ""Guns require a finger to pull the trigger."	0
91hpo36	0	a	In addition, the president is proposing a new initiative that would incentivize police departments to hire more school resource officers and encourage schools to hire more mental health professionals.	0
91nyt28	0	a	Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden are likely to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events in the weeks and months ahead, according to those familiar with the White House strategy.	0
91hpo41	0	a	The proposal would instead affect the future production and sale of military-style weapons or high-capacity magazines.	0
91nyt20	1	a	Ms. Speier said the executive action is part of the “most comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation.”	1
91fox3	0	a	Obama called as well for legislation to bar the possession and importation of armor-piercing bullets and to require criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales.	0
91fox16	0	a	"The call for universal background checks would extend to gun shows and private sales, with ""limited"" exemptions for ""certain transfers"" among family members and other situations."	0
91nyt32	0	a	With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time.	0

12nyt1	0	a	WASHINGTON — With the Senate set to debate gun control this month, a National Rifle Association task force released a 225-page report on Tuesday that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school, and urged states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons.	0

14nyt20	0	a	In an open letter to the people of Ferguson, Mr. Holder said he understood the desire of residents for an “independent” inquiry.	0

14nyt38	0	a	And the police also seemed more restrained, refraining from using tear gas.	0
14hpo1	0	a	The issues raised by Michael Brown's death, Holder said, have simmered “beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson.”	0
14nyt41	0	a	In some instances, teams of officers abruptly entered the crowd, detained a single person whom they had apparently focused on, and returned to West Florissant Avenue, where many of the recent confrontations have occurred.	0

29nyt10	0	a	That’s how John Skipper, 66, a former chairman of the Mobile County Republican Party, characterized the claims, speaking to The New York Times.	0
29fox24	1	a	So it is no surprise, with just over four weeks remaining, in a race for the U.S. Senate with national implications, that the Democratic Party and the country’s most liberal newspaper would come up with a fabrication of this kind.	1
29hpo11	1	a	But after Moore won, Trump disavowed his endorsement of Strange, deleting tweets in support of him.	1
29fox32	0	a	The people of Alabama deserve to know the truth and will make their own decisions.”	0
29fox3	0	a	"""However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside."""	0
29fox31	0	a	I will hold judgment until we know the facts.	0
29nyt2	0	a	The paper found three other women who said they had been pursued by Mr. Moore around the same time, when they were between 16 and 18 years old.	0
29fox8	0	a	"So rest assured — I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!"""	0
29fox22	1	a	“National liberal organizations know their chosen candidate Doug Jones is in a death spiral, and this is their last ditch Hail Mary,” Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said.	1

29fox13	0	a	She said the two did not have sexual intercourse, and that she ended up getting dressed and asking Moore to take her home, according to the Post.	0
29fox11	0	a	On another occasion, she said Moore, then 32, took her to his home in the woods and kissed her.	0
29fox5	1	a	"In a series of tweets Thursday evening, Moore claimed ""The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives."""	1
29hpo1	0	a	White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, traveling with the president on his trip to Asia, told reporters that Trump “believes that we cannot allow a mere allegation ― in this case, one from many years ago ― to destroy a person’s life” but that if the allegations are true, “Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside.”	0
29fox20	0	a	Jones’ campaign told multiple news outlets: “Roy Moore needs to answer these serious charges.”	0
29fox16	0	a	The report caused immediate problems for Moore with his own party as he heads into the Dec. 12 election against Democrat Doug Jones.	0
29nyt21	1	a	Jerry Pow, the party chairman for Bibb County, told Mr. Dale that he’d back Mr. Moore even if the candidate had committed a sex crime.	1
29nyt0	0	a	Republican officials in Alabama staunchly defended their party’s Senate nominee, Roy S. Moore, after a report that he had made sexual advances toward four teenage girls when he was in his 30s.	0
29nyt19	0	a	You can’t be a victim 40 years later, in my opinion.”	0
29fox30	0	a	Alabama's Republican governor, Kay Ivey, responded: “These allegations are deeply disturbing.	0
29fox2	0	a	"“Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,"" Sanders said."	0
29nyt11	0	a	He said that he and other Alabama Republicans would continue to support their candidate and echoed Mr. Moore’s assertion that the Democratic Party had been behind the story.	0
29nyt5	0	a	He is set to face Doug Jones, a Democrat, in a special election next month.	0
29fox1	0	a	Speaking to reporters following the president’s Asia trip on Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also cautioned against a rush to judgment.	0
29nyt6	1	a	The story was met with immediate backlash from Republicans in Alabama, several of whom dismissed the women’s stories out of hand.	1
29fox21	0	a	But Moore’s campaign issued a statement saying the report is “baseless” and false.	0
29fox15	0	a	Moore did take her home, she said.	0
29nyt23	0	a	“I’m not saying I support what he did.”	0
29nyt3	1	a	The Post interviewed more than 30 people in reporting its account.	1
29nyt25	0	a	Mr. Blocker said that he would not change his mind even if there was proof that Mr. Moore was guilty.	0
29fox27	0	a	The statute of limitations, though, has long since passed.	0

85nyt1	0	a	As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors recommended that Mr. Jackson receive a sentence of 46 to 57 months in prison.	0

85hpo13	0	a	The personal expenses at nightclubs and lounges topped $60,000, while personal dry-cleaning expenses topped $14,000.	0

85fox16	0	a	The charge against Sandra Jackson carries a maximum of three years in prison.	0
85nyt24	0	a	One of the more exotic items they bought was an elk head from a taxidermist in Montana.	0
85hpo5	1	a	The former representative, who co-wrote a 1999 book with his father, Rev. Jesse Jackson, titled It's About the Money!: How You Can Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth, and Achieve Your Financial Dreams, was accused of spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items for himself and for his wife.	1
85fox4	0	a	“I did these things. … I used money that should have been used for my campaign.”	0

85fox2	0	a	Sentencing has been set for June 28.	0
85hpo4	0	a	"At one point he appeared to mouth, ""I'm sorry."""	0
85fox10	0	a	The whole hearing lasted about 50 minutes.	0
85nyt21	0	a	In 2008, Mr. Jackson used the money for things like a $466.30 dinner at CityZen in the Mandarin Oriental in Washington and a $5,587.75 vacation at the Martha’s Vineyard Holistic Retreat, the document said.	0
85nyt10	0	a	Mr. Jackson’s plea was yet another chapter in the downward spiral of his career.	0
85nyt22	0	a	On at least two instances, Mr. Jackson and his wife used campaign money at Build-A-Bear Workshop, a store where patrons can create stuffed animals.	0
85nyt25	0	a	According to the documents, Mr. Jackson arranged in March 2011 to have $7,000 paid to the taxidermist, with much of the money coming from a campaign account, and it was shipped a month later to Mr. Jackson’s Congressional office.	0
85fox17	0	a	"However, one of her lawyers, Tom Kirsch, says the plea agreement ""does not contemplate a sentence of that length."""	0
85nyt23	0	a	From December 2007 through December 2008, the Jacksons spent $313.89 on “stuffed animals and accessories for stuffed animals” from Build-A-Bear, according to the documents.	0
85fox3	0	a	“I truly understand the consequences of my actions and of the preceding,” Jackson said through tears.	0
85hpo11	0	a	In a statement issued by his lawyers on Friday after court records indicated he planned a guilty plea, Jackson said he had “no excuses” for his conduct and “fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made.”	0
85nyt13	1	a	Since then, Mr. Jackson, who has said he had no knowledge of the offer, has been dogged by questions about his ethics.	1
85hpo2	0	a	His wife, Sandra Jackson, who resigned from her position on Chicago’s city council, is expected to plead guilty to filing false tax returns before the same judge on Wednesday afternoon.	0
85nyt14	0	a	Last summer, Mr. Jackson took a medical leave from Congress and was later treated for bipolar disorder.	0
85fox8	0	a	His wife later pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of filing false joint federal income tax returns for the years 2006 through 2011 that knowingly understated the income the couple received.	0
85fox21	0	a	As the hearing for Jackson got under way Wednesday, newly filed court papers disclosed that the judge had offered to disqualify himself from handling the cases against Jackson and his wife.	0
85nyt26	0	a	A year later, Mr. Jackson’s wife, knowing that the elk head had been bought with campaign money, had it moved from Washington to Chicago, and she asked a Congressional staff member to sell it, the documents say.	0
85nyt15	0	a	After winning re-election in November, he resigned, citing his health and the federal investigation into his use of campaign money.	0
85fox1	0	a	The Illinois Democrat faces up to five years in prison, but guidelines recommend slightly less.	0
85nyt12	1	a	But as the federal authorities investigated Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois over his efforts to sell the Senate seat that President Obama vacated in 2008, they uncovered evidence that one of Mr. Jackson’s friends had offered to make a contribution to Mr. Blagojevich’s campaign in exchange for the seat.	1

85fox20	0	a	The memorabilia includes a football signed by U.S. presidents, a Michael Jackson fedora, and memorabilia of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Lee -- all from a company called Antiquities of Nevada.	0
85nyt11	0	a	Elected to Congress in 1995 at the age of 30 from a district that includes part of the South Side of Chicago, Mr. Jackson was once one of the most prominent young black politicians in the country, working on issues related to health care and education for the poor.	0
85fox12	0	a	The Jacksons were appearing separately before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins in Washington, D.C. Jackson's wife spent $5,150 on fur capes and parkas, court documents said.	0
85nyt28	0	a	What the staff member did not know was that the interior designer was actually an undercover F.B.I. employee who was investigating the Jacksons, the documents say.	0
85nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Jesse L. Jackson Jr., the former Democratic representative from Illinois, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one felony fraud count in connection with his use of $750,000 in campaign money to pay for living expenses and buy items like stuffed animals, elk heads and fur capes.	0
85nyt4	0	a	“I used money I shouldn’t have used for personal purposes.”	0
85hpo8	0	a	"He acknowledged he ""used money that shouldn't have been used,"" calling the government's statement accurate and saying he had ""no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money."""	0
85hpo6	1	a	Jackson said he was clearheaded and had not been under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, though he did have a beer last night.	1
85fox13	0	a	When prosecutors charged the couple last Friday, the ex-congressman said he fully accepts the responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes he has made.	0
85nyt6	0	a	“Guilty, Your Honor — I misled the American people,” Mr. Jackson said when asked whether he would accept the plea deal.	0
85fox9	0	a	Jackson told the judge that he had been hospitalized for psychological issues.	0
85nyt18	0	a	“That’s not an excuse, it’s just a fact,” Mr. Weingarten said.	0
85nyt5	1	a	At one point during the hearing, the judge stopped his questioning of Mr. Jackson, who was crying, so that he could be given a tissue.	1
85nyt3	0	a	“For years I lived off my campaign,” Mr. Jackson, 47, said in response to questions from the judge about the plea.	0
85nyt27	0	a	In August 2012, the staff member sold the elk head for $5,300 to an interior designer and had the money wired to one of Mr. Jackson’s accounts.	0
85nyt20	0	a	From 2007 to 2011, Mr. Jackson bought $10,977.74 worth of televisions, DVD players and DVDs at Best Buy, according to the documents.	0

85hpo7	0	a	He said he had never been more clear in his life, and had read the documents thoroughly and had understood the consequences of his actions.	0
40fox25	0	a	Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected.	0
40hpo21	0	a	"""These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden."	0
40nyt21	0	a	“I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don’t come out of your mouth the right way,” he said with a gotcha smile.	0
40fox26	1	a	"Biden was quick to retort: ""With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey."	1
40hpo3	0	a	Two instant surveys of Americans watching the debate -- one by CBS, one by CNN -- showed mixed results.	0
40fox17	0	a	The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central.	0
40hpo37	0	a	“Most people probably found the vice president’s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,” said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.	0
40hpo44	0	a	"And that's what happened tonight: they lost the debate."""	0
40nyt16	0	a	Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his own district.	0
40hpo18	0	a	“He was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people.	0
40hpo11	0	a	"Obama adviser David Axelrod said ""Andrew is a unique thinker, and I can't speak for how he might react to this."	0
40nyt14	1	a	And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts.	1
40hpo1	0	a	The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.	0
40hpo48	0	a	One of Ryan’s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments.	0
40hpo14	0	a	"The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed ""passion"" and that he showed ""a great concern for the middle class."""	0
40hpo34	1	a	Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: “Ryan: serious, sober, steady.	1
40nyt25	0	a	She seemed determined to be less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the Obama-Romney debate.	0
40fox18	0	a	Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody.	0
40nyt11	1	a	For Mr. Biden especially, the night was his chance to relive past debates and unleash his inner barroom brawler.	1
40hpo56	0	a	Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.	0
40hpo24	0	a	The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas.	0
40hpo58	0	a	Biden’s argument on Medicare was aimed at voters’ guts, much more so than minds.	0
40fox8	0	a	"""These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,"" Biden said, adding he's ""had it up to here"" with those kinds of comments."	0
40hpo9	1	a	It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -– and buck up -– worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate.	1
40fox46	0	a	"Obama has acknowledged he had a ""bad night"" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward."	0
40fox39	0	a	On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it.	0
40fox15	0	a	There are two more presidential debates on the calendar, and the polls have started to swing in Romney's favor.	0
40hpo13	1	a	"Sullivan, for the record, called the night ""a solid win for Biden"" and called Ryan ""competent."""	1
40hpo6	1	a	"""I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,"" the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida."	1
40hpo40	1	a	“There seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,” Gillespie said.	1
40hpo5	0	a	Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive.	0
40fox20	0	a	"""What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,"" Ryan said."	0
40hpo0	1	a	DANVILLE, Ky. –- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more.	1
40hpo38	0	a	But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.	0
40fox6	1	a	Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not.	1
40hpo7	1	a	Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.	1
40fox1	0	a	The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes.	0
40hpo27	1	a	"After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: ""That's a bunch of malarkey."""	1
40fox13	0	a	"""This is not what a real recovery looks like,"" Ryan said."	0
40hpo47	0	a	"He raised the issue of Romney’s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could “never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."""	0
40hpo4	0	a	But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week.	0
40hpo42	0	a	"""Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics,"" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina."	0
40hpo43	0	a	"""You're going to do that when you've lost a debate."	0
40fox41	0	a	"Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a ""debt crisis is coming"" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit."	0
40hpo29	0	a	At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought.	0
40hpo23	0	a	Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election.	0
40hpo22	1	a	Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years.	1
40nyt9	1	a	Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare.	1
40nyt23	0	a	Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his predecessor’s mistakes.	0
40fox47	0	a	"After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a ""happy warrior"" for the middle class."	0
40nyt4	0	a	Mr. Biden flashed a Cheshire Cat grin and said to Ryan, after waiting a beat to let the moment sink in, “So, now you’re Jack Kennedy?”	0
40hpo20	0	a	Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.	0
40hpo28	1	a	"""Not a single thing he said is accurate,"" Biden said."	1
40nyt8	0	a	It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night.	0
40fox31	0	a	The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate.	0
40hpo26	0	a	It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president.	0
40fox34	0	a	"""Mr. vice president, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other,"" Ryan said."	0
40hpo60	0	a	The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan’s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.	0
40nyt24	0	a	Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the moderator, and she made a point of speaking forcefully, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly.	0
40hpo2	0	a	What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out.	0
40nyt0	0	a	Joe Biden knew Lloyd Bentsen.	0
40fox19	0	a	Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack.	0
40hpo31	0	a	Instead, he got the aggressive label.	0
40hpo32	0	a	Republicans thought it was much more than that.	0
40nyt18	0	a	“I love that. I love that,” Mr. Biden said.	0
40fox14	0	a	Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen.	0
40fox5	1	a	But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged.	1
40hpo53	1	a	But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides.	1
40hpo30	1	a	If it were anyone other than Biden, who is treated by the press as a lovable, half-crazy uncle, he would have been labeled insufferable.	1
40hpo46	0	a	Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago.	0
40fox30	0	a	"On the question of why the administration initially claimed the attack was the result of a protest, Biden explained ""the intelligence community told us that."""	0

40fox0	0	a	In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions.	0

40hpo39	0	a	“I don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,” Gillespie said.	0
40fox33	0	a	Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.	0
40nyt2	0	a	And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleague’s 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle.	0

40fox22	0	a	"""This is becoming more troubling by the day."	0
40nyt7	1	a	He laughed at Mr. Ryan’s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent.	1

40hpo45	0	a	Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else.	0
40nyt13	0	a	This time he let loose.	0

40nyt12	0	a	He had to be contained and courteous when he debated Sarah Palin four years ago, lest he look like a bully.	0
40nyt27	0	a	It wasn’t the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash.	0
40fox2	1	a	But it was the vice president who set the aggressive tone, blatantly striving to hit the reset after President Obama was panned for his lackluster performance at last week's opening debate.	1
40nyt15	1	a	His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the camera.	1

40hpo51	0	a	Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.	0

40hpo57	0	a	Biden didn’t worry so much about numbers.	0
40fox3	0	a	If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.	0
40nyt6	0	a	Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama’s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as “my friend” but dismissing his arguments as “malarkey.”	0

86hpo25	0	a	Even then, Mattis’ recommendation that congressional approval be sought for the strikes put him at odds with the president.	0

95fox1	0	a	The existence of the account was discovered by the House select committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and was first reported by The New York Times.	0
95fox6	0	a	Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, said the former secretary of state expected that emails to State Department officials -- which she sent to department accounts -- would be preserved.	0
95nyt21	0	a	That process could take several months, officials said, because different parts of the State Department must weigh in on whether information should be redacted.	0
95nyt14	1	a	Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman, Mr. Merrill, did not respond to an email seeking comment.	1

95fox24	0	a	However, The Times reports that the imposition of penalties for not complying with federal record-keeping requirements are rare because the National Archives has so few enforcement mechanisms.	0

95nyt28	0	a	The spokeswoman, Marie Harf, was asked on Tuesday whether there was any connection between the requests from Congress and the decision to ask the former secretaries of state for emails from their personal accounts.	0
95hpo10	0	a	While on Mitchell's show, McCain also raised the concern that there's no way of knowing if all of Clinton's emails have been saved, since they were not originally retained by the government.	0

59fox0	0	a	President Obama was heading to Detroit Monday afternoon to continue campaigning for tax hikes on top earners -- a day after a face-to-face meeting with House Speaker John Boehner that offered slight hope the two could be making progress toward a deal.	0
59nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A.

35hpo4	0	a	LePage has been mired in controversy since calling state Rep. Drew Gattine (D) a “son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker” in a voicemail last week.	0
35fox7	0	a	In a recording of the message obtained by the Press Herald, the governor identified himself and went on to curse out Gattine.	0
35nyt2	0	a	“I’m not an alcoholic, and I’m not a drug addict, and I don’t have mental issues,” he said.	0
35fox14	0	a	LePage initially said his outburst was justified because Gattine called him a racist – something Gattine has denied.	0
35hpo20	0	a	Members of LePage’s own party have been trying to deal with the headaches he’s caused as well, with one GOP state senator even talking about censuring him.	0
35hpo27	0	a	Gattine denied to the Portland Press Herald that he ever called the governor a racist.	0
35nyt24	1	a	Even as he fueled outrage among Democrats and angst among many moderate Republicans, his well of support, fed by voters drawn to his unfiltered political style, never seemed to run dry.	1
35fox15	0	a	The alleged name-calling came after LePage said during a town hall that he’s collected a binder full of drug dealers arrested in the state showing that 90 percent of them “are black and Hispanic people from Waterbury, Conn.; the Bronx; and Brooklyn.”	0
35hpo29	1	a	He has said newspapers are his greatest fear and joked about blowing up the headquarters of the Portland Press Herald.	1
35fox5	1	a	During the radio interview, the governor apologized repeatedly for an expletive-ridden voicemail he recently left for Democratic state Rep. Drew Gattine -- the latest controversy to hang over his office.	1
35nyt21	0	a	Democrats have continued to call for Mr. LePage’s ouster, and on Wednesday said they were scheduling meetings with Republican leadership to discuss how to proceed.	0
35nyt14	0	a	“With all due respect, I completely disagree with Representative Fredette’s position,” the Republican leader, Michael Thibodeau, said in a statement.	0
35hpo28	0	a	LePage has long been clear about his distaste for the media.	0
35nyt6	0	a	The controversy, which has galvanized the state, started last Wednesday when Mr. LePage made sweeping statements linking minorities to the state’s drug crisis.	0
35nyt9	0	a	In the ensuing days, Mr. LePage also reiterated his insistence that blacks and Hispanics were the vast majority of those arrested for dealing heroin in Maine.	0
35hpo24	0	a	The latest controversy really dates back to January, when LePage claimed that drug dealers with names like “Smoothie, D-Money and Shifty” come into Maine and “impregnate a young, white girl before they leave.”	0
35fox27	0	a	He later said he had misspoke and meant to say all “Maine women” not only “Maine’s white women.”	0
35nyt28	0	a	And in meeting with reporters, Mr. LePage spoke emotionally about Maine’s heroin crisis.	0
35hpo6	0	a	LePage hinted on Tuesday that he may resign before his term ends in 2018, telling a local radio station, “I’m looking at all options.	0
35fox2	0	a	“I think some things I’ve been asked to do are beyond my ability.	0
35nyt30	1	a	“I didn’t use racially charged language,” Mr. LePage claimed, although he also said, “Let’s leave ethnicity out of it.”	1
35nyt19	0	a	Mr. Katz, a lawyer, suggested it may require only a simple majority of the House and senate, which could reduce the House Republicans’ ability to block such a move, although he added there could be other hurdles to an agreement.	0
35hpo1	0	a	“I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,” he told reporters Wednesday.	0
35hpo21	0	a	State House Minority Leader Ken Fredette (R) said Tuesday night that he would not support bringing the legislature back into a special session to consider sanctions against LePage ― a position that his counterpart in the Senate wouldn’t back.	0
35fox11	0	a	You … I need you to, just friggin.	0
35fox23	1	a	A year later, LePage said that NAACP officials, who had called him out for not attending a Martin Luther King Jr.’s event, could “kiss my butt.”	1
35nyt8	0	a	The governor then left him an expletive-laden voicemail message, which he followed up by threatening to shoot the lawmaker between the eyes.	0
35nyt13	0	a	That decision did not sit well with some other state Republicans, and on Wednesday morning, the spotlight shifted to them as the president of the Senate, whose members govern larger and more competitive districts, made a public break with his colleagues in the House.	0
35fox4	0	a	Later in the day, LePage took to Twitter, though, to push back on media reports about a possible resignation.	0
35nyt10	0	a	Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the remarks, as many legislators called for a special session to at least rebuke the governor over his latest tirade.	0
35nyt18	0	a	There is no precedent for such a situation here — a fact that has sent lawmakers like Senator Roger Katz, a Republican who has been critical of Mr. LePage, back to reading their state Constitutions on Wednesday to figure out what, if anything, they could do now to convene a special session.	0
35nyt16	0	a	Mr. Thibodeau said many Senate Republicans were still deciding whether or not Mr. LePage’s apology and promise to seek “spiritual guidance” had allayed their concerns about the governor — a process that could deepen their divide with Republicans in the House and pull the controversy into a second week.	0

35nyt0	0	a	AUGUSTA, Me. — Paul R. LePage, the embattled Republican governor of Maine, declared on Wednesday that he would not step down despite widespread criticism over a profane threat and generalizations about drugs and race that had prompted him to hint on Tuesday that he might abort his second term.	0
35hpo23	0	a	“The Republican Senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made.”	0
35hpo19	0	a	He said he will be seeking “spiritual guidance” from his family.	0
35fox28	0	a	LePage’s second and final term as governor officially ends in 2019.	0
35nyt25	0	a	By all indications, Mr. LePage seemed determined to again ride out the political storm.	0
35hpo25	0	a	Last week, LePage tried to back up that statement ― which had been widely criticized at the time ― by saying he keeps a binder of drug dealers arrested in Maine and “90-plus percent of those pictures” in his book are of black and Hispanic individuals.	0
35nyt27	0	a	Mr. LePage spoke shortly after he met with — and apologized to — Representative Drew Gattine, the state Democratic lawmaker who had been the recipient of the angry voice mail.	0
35fox10	0	a	I’ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-b----, socialist c---sucker.	0
35hpo11	0	a	On Wednesday morning, LePage said unequivocally that he will be staying put.	0
35fox21	1	a	But this isn’t the first time LePage’s comments have gotten him in trouble.	1
35hpo5	1	a	After widespread criticism ― including from members of his own party ― he apologized.	1
35nyt22	0	a	“Coming back in for a special session will be discussed and all options around the governor’s political future are on the table,” said the Democratic leader of the Senate, Justin Alfond.	0
35nyt26	0	a	“I want to put this behind us,” Mr. LePage said, during a meeting with a select group of reporters in his office on Wednesday morning, adding, “I will never talk about it again.”	0
35fox3	0	a	I’m not going to say that I’m not going to finish it. I’m not saying that I am going to finish it.”	0
35hpo15	1	a	“Every day, Paul LePage gives Maine people more evidence that he is unfit for office,” State House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe (D) and Assistant House Majority Leader Sara Gideon (D) said in a statement Tuesday night.	1
35nyt5	1	a	Behind the scenes, state lawmakers — Democrats and Senate Republicans — exasperated after six years of political controversies and what they saw as erratic behavior, were scrambling to figure out what, if anything, they could do to formally address this latest crisis.	1
35fox24	1	a	In 2015, LePage was forced to apologize to the son of a cartoonist for The Bangor Daily News because he told him he’d “like to shoot” his father.	1
35hpo8	0	a	I’m not going to say that I’m not going to finish it.	0
35fox13	0	a	Thank you,” he said in the message.	0
35nyt7	0	a	As criticism against him swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker had called him a racist.	0
35nyt29	0	a	But he but did not apologize for statements he made last week that linked trafficking in the drug to blacks and Hispanics.	0
35fox26	0	a	In January, he said drug dealers with names like “D-Money, Smoothie (and) Shifty” are getting Maine’s white women pregnant.	0
35nyt23	0	a	Mr. LePage’s six years in office here, which began as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, have been marked by controversy.	0
35fox19	0	a	When you go to war ... you try to identify the enemy.	0
35hpo2	0	a	“And I’m serious. Everything will be put into writing.	0

35fox20	0	a	"The enemy right now, the overwhelming majority of people coming in, are people of color or people of Hispanic origin."""	0
35hpo13	1	a	Democrats have been pounding LePage, saying that he needs to step down and questioning his mental abilities.	1
35hpo10	1	a	He walked back his remarks later that day, criticizing “rumors” that he was going to resign ― even though they came directly from LePage himself.	1
35hpo9	0	a	I’m not saying that I am going to finish it.”	0

35fox1	0	a	“I’m looking at all options,” LePage said on talk radio station WVOM.	0
35fox16	0	a	The leaked voicemail prompted members of LePage’s own party to question his ability to lead the state.	0
35hpo26	0	a	LePage was upset because he mistakenly believed Gattine heard those remarks and called him a racist, and so he left him the voicemail.	0
35fox6	1	a	Earlier, the Republican governor had refused to apologize for the message, even saying at press conference he wished it was 1825 so he could shoot Gattine in a duel.	1
35fox18	0	a	I don't care what color it is.	0
35hpo18	0	a	“What I have is a backbone, and I want to move Maine forward.”	0
35fox9	0	a	I want to talk to you I want you to prove that I’m a racist.	0
35nyt12	0	a	But on Tuesday, Mr. LePage’s Republican allies in the House, including the minority leader, Kenneth Fredette, announced that they would oppose those efforts — essentially shielding him from any official political consequence.	0
35hpo22	0	a	“With all due respect, I completely disagree with Fredette’s position,” Senate President Mike Thibodeau (R) said Wednesday.	0
35nyt4	0	a	Mr. LePage nevertheless said he was seeking “spiritual guidance,” had apologized for his threat, and vowed to make one change to his behavior: “I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,” he said.	0

66fox11	1	a	Brian Brown, president of the National Organization of Marriage, believes that giving same sex couples the right to file jointly “continues a pattern of lawlessness” across the country.	1
66nyt34	0	a	That means same-sex couples would receive benefits as long as they are legally married, regardless of where they live.	0
66nyt35	0	a	But the Social Security Administration is now using a “place of residence” standard in determining spousal benefits, and a gay couple in Alabama might not receive the same benefits as a gay couple in New York until final determinations are made or Congress acts.	0
66nyt15	0	a	Couples do not have to file amended returns if they do not want to, a senior Treasury official said, meaning that couples who might pay the marriage penalty would not owe back taxes.	0
66nyt9	0	a	Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling.	0
66nyt20	0	a	She sees it as a paperwork bother more than a financial issue.	0
66nyt3	0	a	The Treasury Department answered some of those questions on Thursday.	0
66hpo17	1	a	“These families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.”	1
66hpo20	1	a	UPDATE: Commenting on the Treasury Department's new policy, Edie Windsor hailed the decision as the precise remedy that she sought when she challenged the constitutionality of DOMA.	1
66fox0	0	a	WASHINGTON – Legally married same-sex couples will now be allowed to file federal joint tax returns, the IRS and Treasury Department announced Thursday.	0
66nyt14	0	a	At the same time, same-sex couples will also be able to file amended returns for certain prior tax years, meaning that many couples might be eligible for refunds.	0
66hpo18	0	a	The Treasury’s actions on Thursday are just the latest in a set of LGBT policies offered by agencies within the Obama administration following the DOMA ruling.	0
66hpo11	0	a	Had they been a heterosexual couple, Windsor's tax burden would have been zero.	0
66hpo6	1	a	It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,” Lew said in a statement.	1
66nyt26	0	a	But it would be partly offset by new federal spending on benefits for same-sex spouses.	0
66hpo5	0	a	“Today’s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide.	0
66fox6	0	a	"""Today's ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide."	0
66nyt19	0	a	“There’s going to be a cumbersome workaround,” said Nanette Lee Miller of Marcum L.L.P., a public accounting firm.	0
66nyt4	0	a	As of the 2013 tax year, same-sex spouses who are legally married will not be able to file federal tax returns as if either were single.	0
66nyt28	0	a	But it does not extend to civil unions, registered domestic partnerships or other legal relationships, the Treasury said.	0
66fox10	0	a	Not everyone was on board with the decision.	0
66nyt33	0	a	Medicare and Treasury officials have said they would use a “place of celebration” standard for determining whether gay couples are eligible for benefits.	0
66nyt32	0	a	Instead, they are creating a patchwork of regulations affecting gay and lesbian couples — and may be raising questions about discrimination and fairness in the way that federal benefits are distributed.	0
66nyt38	0	a	Creating federal regulations is a process and could change, she said.	0
66nyt24	0	a	“We will need to see guidance from each nonrecognition state to see how this will be handled.”	0
66fox5	0	a	The rules, though, would not apply to domestic partnerships and civil unions.	0
66hpo13	0	a	Under the new Treasury policy, all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor, including filing status, employee benefits, IRA contributions, earned income, child tax credits, and income, gift and estate taxes, will apply to same sex couples regardless of where they live.	0
66hpo7	0	a	“This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.”	0
66fox8	1	a	Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said that, because of today’s ruling, “committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation’s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home.”	1
66nyt18	0	a	Now, they will have to file their federal returns as other married couples do, but may be required to file their state returns as individuals.	0
66nyt16	0	a	But the ruling creates complications for same-sex couples who live in any of the 37 states that do not recognize their marriages.	0
66nyt2	0	a	The June decision found that same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits, but left open the question of how Washington would actually administer them.	0
66nyt31	0	a	But federal agencies are not moving in lock step.	0
66nyt21	0	a	States might also respond to the federal ruling with changes of their own.	0
66hpo15	0	a	The policy only applies to married couples, and not those in domestic partnerships or same-sex unions.	0
66nyt23	0	a	“These state taxing authorities will have to figure out how to deal with a same-sex married couple who file a joint income tax return for federal tax purposes.” He added,	0
66nyt25	0	a	The rule change is likely to provide a small increase for federal revenue, as more same-sex couples pay the marriage penalty, Mr. Williams said, describing it as a “rounding error.”	0
66fox12	1	a	"""The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex 'marriage' on an unwilling public,"" Brown said in a written statement."	1
66fox2	0	a	Thursday’s announcement comes on the heels of a historic decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned a part of the Defense of Marriage Act earlier this year.	0
66fox9	1	a	He added, “These families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.”	1
66hpo3	0	a	Once DOMA was overturned in June, the question became: What about same-sex married couples who moved to a state that didn’t recognize their marriage (a couple married in Massachusetts who moved to Arkansas, for example)?	0
66nyt12	1	a	But the Treasury decision could have ramifications for many gay couples’ tax liabilities, said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington.	1
38nyt1	0	a	Ms. Pelosi’s victory over Representative Tim Ryan, a 43-year-old congressman from a blue-collar district anchored in Youngstown, Ohio, ensures that the party will be led in the next Congress by the established “coastal” Democrats who have increasingly defined it — Ms. Pelosi, 76, who represents San Francisco, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, 66, who has held various leadership posts since 2005.	0

38nyt25	0	a	“Just because you’re only getting 30 percent of the vote in some area doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go there,” said Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana.	0
38nyt22	0	a	The Democratic leaders seemed short on concrete strategies, too, committing generally to refocus their message on economic issues.	0
38nyt34	1	a	But each new idea has underscored the fact that Ms. Pelosi refuses to relinquish much power and has cultivated a large, loyal following that does not expect her to.	1
38fox29	1	a	She won despite her proposals doing little to ensure new blood at the very top or changing the seniority system that has key committees led by lawmakers in their 80s at a moment when the party needs to be defending ObamaCare and other initiatives by President Obama.	1
38hpo21	0	a	“We know how to win elections,” she added.	0
38hpo24	0	a	Separately, Ryan told reporters the race didn’t turn out as he wanted but he thinks he did “a pretty good job” of bringing economic issues to the forefront.	0

38hpo17	0	a	The California Democrat spoke briefly to reporters after the vote, saying she feels “exhilarated” at being re-elected.	0
38fox19	0	a	The 76-year-old Pelosi, in the months prior to the Nov. 8 elections, repeatedly vowed that her party would retake control of the lower chamber, despite needing to gain roughly 35 seats.	0
38hpo25	0	a	“I think we got the message out,” he said.	0
38fox7	0	a	“Clearly, this didn’t turn out the way we wanted,” Ryan said after the vote.	0
38nyt27	0	a	Disappointed by the outcome of the leadership election, a handful of Democrats who had backed Mr. Ryan vowed to press forward with a proposal to turn some jobs, such as the chairman of the party’s campaign arm, into elected positions.	0
38fox35	0	a	Democrats until Wednesday had never had a female minority in their leadership ranks.	0
38fox12	1	a	“We didn’t lose today,” she said, interrupting reporters at the post-vote press conference.	1
38hpo7	0	a	Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2003, and that’s what Ryan had argued is the problem.	0
38hpo9	0	a	Some say they’re not the right messengers to energize the base and convey an economic message that appeals to people beyond the two coasts.	0
38fox2	0	a	She won by a 134-to-63 vote.	0
38hpo23	0	a	Asked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan, Pelosi said, “I got two-thirds of the vote.”	0
38nyt3	1	a	But while Ms. Pelosi won, 134 to 63, Mr. Ryan’s significant share of the total served as a measure of internal discontent and in some ways a repudiation of Ms. Pelosi’s leadership.	1

38fox28	1	a	In the days before Wednesday’s vote, Pelosi, a prolific fundraiser, promised some changes to assuage concerns in her caucus, including adding a member of the freshmen class to her leadership team.	1
38nyt24	0	a	Some of the more specific strategies considered included starting a more aggressive recruitment campaign for Democratic candidates from more conservative areas, as well as increasing their outreach to traditionally “red” districts.	0
38fox3	0	a	Pelosi said afterward that she was “exhilarated” by the strong support and reminded reporters that she had accurately predicted winning two-thirds of the vote.	0

1nyt1	1	a	In fact, Republicans may have gotten more than they bargained for by shunning him.	1
1fox9	0	a	Trump on Tuesday specifically cited Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement.	0
1hpo8	0	a	As the days went on, Trump began making noises about possibly canceling the debate; however, as late as Monday night, he was still saying that the forum was taking place.	0
1nyt5	1	a	Mr. Trump drew considerable criticism from the Republican establishment for moderating a presidential debate while openly saying that he might still run if he was displeased with the candidates.	1
1fox6	0	a	Though the Dec. 27 debate technically is sponsored by Newsmax, Trump quickly became the face of it after he was named as moderator.	0
1nyt3	0	a	“It is very important to me that the right Republican candidate be chosen to defeat the failed and very destructive Obama administration,” Mr. Trump said in his statement.	0
1nyt8	0	a	Mr. Trump was facing a potentially awkward task: moderating a debate that only two candidates said they would attend.	0
1fox4	0	a	"""I am looking at it, if the Republicans choose the wrong candidate, which is a possibility, and if the economy continues to be bad, which I think it will be,"" Trump said."	0
10fox16	0	a	"""We fail to show the American people that imperfection is not to be feared and that our ability to constantly improve on what the Founders gave us is a blessing, not a reason for divisiveness."""	0
10fox12	0	a	"""I think it would be helpful to the members if you would explain to us how the determinations of what to read has been made or not made so that we all be on the same page as to congressional intent,"" he said to Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who presided over the reading."	0
10nyt6	0	a	From there, members who wished to read were recognized from their seats, beginning with Representative Steve Rothman, Democrat of New Jersey.	0
10nyt10	0	a	Largely, it was meant to instruct members, who now must use it to underlie their bills, and to inform voters.	0
10fox1	0	a	Turned out it wasn't.	0
10nyt8	1	a	At one point, there was yelling in the chamber, and the sergeant-at-arms was called to remove a protester.	1
10fox32	0	a	"""The Constitution, they wrote that to ensure limited government and they meant for most of us to live our lives free from government, in the private sector, planning and living our own lives, not as dependents on government goods and services."""	0
10fox36	0	a	As the Constitution was being read inside the lower chamber, Nadler and others gathered outside the Capitol to push for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, a perennial effort to update the document with a statement on women.	0
10fox25	0	a	And backers said that it wouldn't hurt to try to live by the aspirations of the Founding Fathers.	0
10nyt4	1	a	These inquiries about parliamentary procedure were not well received, and for several minutes, before a word of the preamble could be uttered, Democrats and Republicans battled back and forth over the issue of language, perhaps presaging future partisan battles over the meaning, purpose and application of the document.	1
10fox17	0	a	Other lawmakers decried the exercise altogether, saying the Constitution is a living document that shouldn't be followed to the letter.	0
10hpo5	0	a	“Call it the tea party-ization of Congress. ...	0
10fox11	0	a	Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., commented that the original document has been changed through amendment, leaving the the reader to interpret the operative language.	0
10nyt7	0	a	And so, sentence by sentence, in accents that reflect the myriad districts that did not even exist when the document came into being, by women and African Americans whose full rights were not recognized at that time, the constitutional language fluttered through the chamber.	0
10hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON - And on the second day of Republican rule, the House read the Constitution.	0
10fox14	0	a	"""To not read the full document, including all the text that was later amended, is to fail to acknowledge the struggle our nation has constantly fought, within and without, to 'keep' our Republic,"" he said in a written statement."	0
10fox30	0	a	But Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute said Congress needs to re-read the Constitution to be reminded how out of control government has become.	0
10fox31	0	a	"""Today the Congress regulates our lives and redistributes our wealth in ways that would shock the Founders,"" he said."	0
10nyt18	0	a	But the office could not find any examples of the full text of the Constitution actually being read out loud on the House Floor.	0

10fox35	0	a	"If that were so, it would never have been ratified in the first place,"" he said."	0
10nyt2	0	a	Before the reading began, Jay Inslee, Democrat of Washington, asked Republicans to illuminate exactly what part of the Constitution would be read, what parts would be deleted and who would decide how things would unfold.	0
10fox7	0	a	But all the original decisions remain in the Constitution, including in the copies authorized by Congress' Joint Committee on Printing and used in Thursday's reading.	0
10nyt13	0	a	But it was also clearly meant as a nod to the Tea Party, a loosely organized political movement whose members cite the Constitution as the basis for much of their political theory concerning federal powers and the rights and responsibilities of Congress.	0
10fox37	0	a	"""John Boehner and his cronies are holding up the U.S. Constitution as a sacred, perfect document."	0
10fox29	1	a	"Historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia University told Fox News the reading may be ""a bit of theater,"" but it is ""not insignificant given that many Republicans have decided -- implausibly, in my opinion -- that the Constitution is the vehicle that can reduce the size of government."""	1

10fox27	0	a	"I think it's a valuable exercise and an important moment in this Congress for us to read the Constitution,"" said Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y."	0
10nyt11	0	a	“Throughout the last year there has been a great debate about the expansion of the federal government, and lots of my constituents have said that Congress has gone beyond its powers granted in the Constitution,” said Mr. Goodlatte, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over constitutional amendments.	0
10fox8	0	a	And that was the point of contention for Democratic lawmakers who complained that exempting parts of the document from the reading undermines the objective of the exercise.	0
10hpo10	0	a	“Beyond its symbolic power, however, it is unclear what impact the new rule will have upon the nation.	0
10hpo12	0	a	Moreover, by taking their oaths of office, lawmakers swear to abide by the Constitution, and virtually all legislation is vetted for constitutional support on some level by government lawyers before it makes it to committee or to the floor of the House.	0
10fox5	0	a	Republicans also left out the part about counting slaves and Native Americans as three-fifths of a person.	0
10nyt16	0	a	“We have spread the word to everyone, and there was a lot of interest,” he said.	0
10hpo11	1	a	Under axiomatic legal precedent, virtually all congressional action is presumed valid anyway, at least initially.	1
10fox6	0	a	Portions of the U.S. Constitution are never deleted, just amended, as has been done 27 times in history.	0
10hpo14	1	a	According to Peter Keating at Vanity Fair, $1.1 million is the estimated cost of GOP plans to read the document on the House floor. 	1
10fox34	0	a	"""When liberals tell today that the Constitution is essentially a blank slate to be filled by transient majorities, nothing could be further from the truth."	0
10fox9	0	a	"""This is very emotional for me,"" Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., said on the floor before the reading began."	0
10fox22	0	a	"""You are supposed to govern your government by it."""	0
10nyt3	0	a	It was decided in advance that any portion of the Constitution that was superseded by amendments — including the amendments themselves — would not be read, preventing lawmakers from having to make references to slaves, referred to in Article 1, Section 2 as “three fifths of all other persons,” or to things like prohibition.	0
10hpo8	0	a	A pillar of their grass-roots movement will become a staple in the bureaucracy that governs Congress.”	0
10hpo13	1	a	It is also quite obvious, from 223 years of legal and political debate on the topic, that the text of the Constitution itself, including those portions that deal with legislative power, is susceptible to many different (and often evolving) views and interpretations, a practical reality that would likely render most “Constitutional Authority Statements” controversial and contentious.”	1
10hpo16	0	a	$1,071,872.87, to be exact, though of course this is more back-of-the-envelope than exact.	0
10fox13	0	a	"Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the reading of the ""amended"" Constitution."	0
10nyt5	0	a	Once that was settled, just after 11 a.m., Representative John A. Boehner, the newly installed speaker of the House, read the preamble (that magical “We the people”), before yielding to the woman who handed him the gavel on Wednesday, Representative Nancy Pelosi, who picked up with Article 1, Section 1 (“All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives”), followed by Representative Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, and other House leaders.	0
10fox0	1	a	Even for a Congress known to battle over every little detail, reading the U.S. Constitution aloud sounded like a simple exercise.	1
10hpo20	1	a	“These new rules show that Republicans are serious about respecting the Constitution.”	1
10fox24	0	a	"""I think that this is a very symbolic showing to the American people and reminder to the members of congress that we are a government of laws not of men and that this Constitution is the foundation for all of our laws,"" Goodlatte said."	0
10hpo22	0	a	Republicans have estimated that this will save $35 million over the next nine months.	0
10hpo15	0	a	“The amount I get is nearly $1.1 million.	0
10hpo21	0	a	Also on Thursday, the House is to take up its first spending cut measure, a proposed 5 percent trim in the budgets of leadership, rank-and-file member and committee offices.	0
10fox23	1	a	But for all those who described the exercise as political waste -- including Vanity Fair magazine, which estimated it as costing more than $1 million -- supporters noted that it was an historic moment -- the first time the U.S. Constitution had been read on the U.S. House floor.	1
10hpo6	0	a	These are two standout changes on a long list of new rules Republicans will institute in the House when they assume the majority on Jan. 5.	0
10fox3	0	a	For instance, lawmakers did not read the 18th Amendment, which imposed prohibition on liquor in 1919.	0
10nyt15	0	a	The order of reading was ironed out at the last minute, with the goal of letting all who wished to read do so, but making sure there was party parity, Mr. Goodlatte said.	0
10fox20	0	a	"He argued that the Founders were not ""demigods"" and that the document's needs for amendments to abolish slavery and other injustices showed it was ""highly imperfect."""	0
10nyt17	0	a	According to the Office of the Historian of the House of Representatives, the only two prior instances in which a full or partial text of the Constitution was inserted into the Congressional Record was in 1882, when Roswell Flower of New York “appended” a text of the Constitution — minus the amendments — into the record, and in 1915, when Thomas Reilly of Connecticut inserted the full text of the Constitution into the Congressional Record as an extension of his remarks.	0
10fox2	0	a	Newly sworn members of the House reading aloud the country's founding document on Thursday didn't recite every verse and article of the document because Republicans decided that the obsolete parts can be skipped since they've been superseded by amendment.	0
10fox38	0	a	"But we know the Constitution is far from perfect because it does not guarantee women's equality,"" NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a statement."	0
10hpo2	0	a	Republicans have made strict adherence to the Constitution a key tenet of their effort to reduce the size of the federal government.	0
10hpo19	0	a	“On November 2nd, voters called for an end to reckless spending and a renewed commitment to the Constitution,” said Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who has emerged a prominent voice of the Tea Party movement, to the Post.	0

10nyt0	0	a	Setting the tone for the 112th Congress — in which every House bill must cite the constitutional source of its authority — members of the House of Representatives began to read the United States Constitution aloud from the chamber’s floor on Thursday morning.	0
10fox19	1	a	"Nadler derided what he called the ""ritualistic reading"" as ""total nonsense"" and ""propaganda"" intended to give Republicans claim to the document."	1
10hpo1	0	a	Those wondering whether the reading would be dramatic found out on Thursday as volunteers gave voice to the seven articles and 27 amendments that make up the nation’s governing document.	0
10nyt9	0	a	The reading of the document on the floor of the House, an act that is part of the new rules package, serves several purposes, said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who came up with the idea for the live reading.	0
10hpo4	0	a	The Washington Post reported last week that reading the founding document in full appears to be a first in the chamber’s 221-year history:	0
10hpo3	0	a	The House GOP will reportedly make it a requirement that all new bills put forth in the legislative body include “a statement by the lawmaker who wrote it citing the constitutional authority to enact the proposed legislation.”	0

24fox25	0	a	“Make no mistake,” he said. 	0
24nyt17	0	a	Citing details in emails and other forms of communications, the indictment suggested that Mr. Trump’s campaign knew about additional stolen emails before they were released and asked Mr. Stone to find out about them.	0
24nyt6	0	a	F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Stone before dawn, appearing at his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home with ballistic vests and guns drawn.	0
24fox39	0	a	Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements in a case brought by Mueller in November. 	0
24fox17	0	a	The 24-page indictment released early Friday alleges that Stone worked to obstruct the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election by making false statements to the committee, denying he had records sought by the committee and persuading a witness to provide false testimony.	0
24hpo16	0	a	He told The Washington Post that he met with a Russian national who wanted to sell Trump damaging information on Hillary Clinton for a sum of $2 million.	0
24fox5	0	a	"Stone will appear on Fox News Channel's ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on Friday at 8 p.m. ET."	0
24nyt29	0	a	In social media posts and interviews during the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Stone indicated that he had advance knowledge that a trove of information damaging to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign might be about to spill into public view, and even suggested that he had personally spoken to the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange.	0
24nyt27	1	a	His brash behavior made him less of a subject of news media scrutiny than other current and former aides to President Trump — like the character in a whodunit whom readers immediately dismiss as too obvious to have committed the crime.	1
24fox16	0	a	He added: “If the FBI and the Mueller team believe Stone has engaged in witness tampering, then there is a palpable distrust, which would make them err on the side of surprise, rather than a courtesy phone call.”	0
24hpo9	0	a	Stone was “contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases” by WikiLeaks, according to the indictment, which refers to WikiLeaks as “Organization 1.”	0
24hpo1	0	a	A federal grand jury impaneled by special counsel Robert Mueller charged Stone in a seven-count indictment.	0
24nyt44	1	a	Mr. Stone told Mr. Credico he should “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’” before the House committee, the indictment said, a reference to a “Godfather” character who lies to Congress about his interactions with the Mafia.	1
24fox20	0	a	But former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joseph diGenova blasted the tactic as “outrageous.”	0
24nyt46	0	a	When Mr. Trump formally announced during the spring of 2015 that he was running for president, Mr. Stone was one of the first to join his campaign.	0
24fox12	0	a	The source told Fox News that home arrests typically take place early in the morning with a team of FBI agents in protective gear, adding that Stone’s situation was “nothing out of the ordinary.”	0
24nyt22	0	a	The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, sought to broadly distance Mr. Trump from the charges.	0
24nyt3	0	a	The indictment made no mention of whether Mr. Trump played a role in the coordination, though Mr. Mueller did leave a curious clue about how high in the campaign the effort reached: A senior campaign official “was directed” by an unnamed person to contact Mr. Stone about additional WikiLeaks releases that might damage the Clinton campaign, according to the court document.	0
24hpo18	0	a	Stone’s indictment came after his associate Randy Credico, a radio show host, testified before the grand jury.	0
24fox19	0	a	Instead, it accuses him of witness tampering, obstruction and false statements about his interactions related to WikiLeaks' release.	0
24nyt12	0	a	Afterward, in a theatrical appearance outside the courthouse, Mr. Stone vowed to beat what he called politically motivated charges.	0
24nyt4	1	a	In an indictment filled with colorful details about clandestine meetings, angry texts — even a reference to “The Godfather: Part II” — Mr. Stone was charged with seven counts, including obstruction, making false statements and witness tampering.	1

24nyt37	0	a	A day before Mr. Stone and Mr. Bannon emailed about WikiLeaks, Donald Trump Jr. exchanged messages on Twitter with the WikiLeaks account and asked, “What’s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about.”	0
24nyt18	0	a	According to the indictment, between June and July 2016, Mr. Stone told “senior Trump campaign officials” about the stolen emails in WikiLeaks’ possession that could be damaging to Mrs. Clinton.	0

24nyt40	0	a	The special counsel’s investigators spent months encircling Mr. Stone, and the indictment unsealed on Friday detailed how he relied on several longtime associates to get information about the timing and content of WikiLeaks’ document releases in the months before the election.	0
24hpo10	0	a	Stone’s attorney, Grant Smith, said in a statement that “there was no Russian collusion” and that the charges were “a clear attempt at silencing Roger.”	0
24nyt31	0	a	Still, it was revealed last year that, in the weeks before the election, Mr. Stone was messaging on Twitter with Guccifer 2.0, a pseudonym used by one or more operatives in the Russian intelligence scheme to steal the emails and funnel them to WikiLeaks.	0
24fox8	0	a	“A telephone call would have done the job, and he would have appeared. 	0
24fox15	0	a	“The wild card here is that in charging Stone with a form of obstruction of justice, the Mueller team may view it differently than typical white-collar investigations.”	0
24fox23	0	a	He added: “For those of us who have been prosecutors and have prosecuted mob figures, drug dealers and terrorists—those are the people for whom these aggressive tactics are reserved. 	0
24hpo13	0	a	He also affirmed that he does not plan to testify against Trump, but would not say if he seeks a pardon from the president.	0
24fox4	0	a	“But the FBI agents were extraordinarily courteous.”	0
24hpo14	0	a	The July 2018 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers in connection with the hack of a Democratic National Committee server during the 2016 election referred to Stone as “a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.”	0
24nyt8	0	a	Prosecutors sealed details of the case because they feared that public disclosure would increase the risk of Mr. Stone fleeing or destroying or tampering with evidence, according to court documents.	0
24hpo8	0	a	The indictment alleges he spoke “to senior Trump Campaign officials” about WikiLeaks and “information it might have had that would be damaging” to the campaign of Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the summer before the election.	0
24fox13	0	a	A former senior Justice Department official, now-white collar criminal attorney with Ifrah Law, James Trusty, told Fox News that while common procedure in white collar cases would involve a federal prosecutor contacting the defendant’s attorney, Stone’s charges could have sparked a different approach.	0
24hpo15	0	a	Stone has described his contact with the Russians ― who used the handle “Guccifer 2.0” ― as “benign.”	0
24hpo12	0	a	“I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated,” he said, while onlookers booed.	0
24hpo6	0	a	He repeatedly has said it was “a possibility” that he would be indicted in Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible Trump campaign collusion.	0
24fox27	0	a	DiGenova likened the FBI arrest of Stone to the bureau’s early morning raid last summer of the home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.	0

24nyt43	0	a	He exchanged heated texts with Randy Credico, a New York radio host with his own contacts with WikiLeaks, pressuring Mr. Credico to lie to the Intelligence Committee so that his story would line up with Mr. Stone’s.	0
24nyt49	0	a	On Friday, the day that Mr. Stone stood on the steps of a courthouse and pledged his enduring loyalty to the president, Mr. Trump bashed the investigation that had led armed federal agents to his friend’s house in the morning darkness.	0

24hpo0	1	a	Roger Stone, an eccentric longtime Republican strategist with a tattoo of Richard Nixon’s face on his back, was arrested early Friday on criminal charges that include obstruction of an official proceeding, false statements and witness tampering.	1
24fox2	1	a	CNN, which conveniently happened to be staking out Stone's Fort Lauderdale home, posted video of the arrest that showed a team of FBI agents with guns banging on Stone’s door and demanding that he come outside.	1
24fox7	1	a	“A SWAT team, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs—it was completely unnecessary,” Stone’s attorney said. 	1
24nyt45	0	a	The tumultuous relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump goes back decades, with Mr. Stone serving as an informal adviser as Mr. Trump considered running for president several times.	0
24nyt15	0	a	In a brief interview later, Mr. Stone said he will plead not guilty, and people close to him have predicted that Mr. Trump could pardon Mr. Stone should he be convicted of any of the charges.	0
24nyt20	0	a	After that, according to the indictment, the Trump campaign sought more.	0
24hpo19	0	a	Stone, according to the indictment, “on multiple occasions” around Dec. 1, 2017, told Credico (“Person 2”) that he should “do a ‘Frank Pentangeli’” in his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence “to avoid contradicting Stone’s testimony.”	0
