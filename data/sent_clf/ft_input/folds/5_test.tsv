80hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers.	0

80nyt52	0	a	“That could very well be the case,” Mr. Sellers said.	0
80fox11	0	a	Sellers said that wasn't a fair comparison because Wal-Mart has an obligation under federal law to make sure its managers do not discriminate.	0

80nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart.	0
80nyt23	0	a	Mr. Sellers responded that “there is this broad discretion given the managers” but that “they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.” Managers, he went on, “are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.”	0
80nyt16	0	a	But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores.	0

80hpo17	0	a	"""We're talking about getting a foot in the door,"" Ginsburg said, a standard she called not hard to meet."	0
80hpo10	0	a	Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit.	0
80nyt2	0	a	Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.	0
80fox32	0	a	That potential ruling would get Wal-Mart off the hook for any financial damages.	0
80fox24	0	a	Much of the hour-long argument delved into the tedious details of class action law and if the Wal-Mart women could properly certify their claims into a single case.	0
80fox31	0	a	It's possible that instead of an outright victory for Wal-Mart, the justices could issue a split decision of sorts and allow only the injunction part of the lawsuit to move forward.	0

80nyt44	0	a	Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. “The comparison that’s relevant,” he said, “is between men and women and Wal-Mart.”	0
80nyt42	0	a	Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.	0
80nyt49	0	a	Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.	0

80fox28	0	a	Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking.	0
80hpo32	0	a	David Sanford, who represents plaintiffs in other class-action cases, said after the arguments that the court seemed inclined to rule against the Wal-Mart women.	0
80nyt37	0	a	Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.	0
80fox5	0	a	"The lawsuit alleges that the company's corporate culture, described in court Tuesday as the ""Wal-Mart Way,"" fosters the advancement of male workers over their female counterparts."	0
80fox25	0	a	Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued that every member of the class couldn't possibly meet a standard of commonality to justify the lawsuit.	0
80nyt30	0	a	Several justices had practical concerns.	0
80hpo8	0	a	"""Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion."	0
80nyt19	0	a	And Justice Elena Kagan said that “excessive subjectivity” may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.	0
80nyt34	0	a	Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart’s personnel decisions were “standardless” and “recordless.”	0
80nyt50	0	a	“So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,” Justice Alito said.	0
80nyt18	0	a	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces.	0
80hpo28	0	a	Business interests have lined up with Wal-Mart while civil rights, women's and consumer groups have sided with the women plaintiffs.	0
80fox16	0	a	Wal-Mart's appeal is asking the Supreme Court to stop the case from ever getting to a trial judge.	0
80nyt39	0	a	“Then he says we’re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision.	0
80nyt21	0	a	“I’m getting whipsawed here,” he told the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers.	0
80fox7	0	a	This dual argument that confounded Justice Kennedy also drew the ire of Justice Antonin Scalia who said he was whipsawed by the claims.	0
28hpo18	0	a	During a Thursday Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) trashed the idea of Lieberman, or any politician, being in charge of the FBI, according to a senior Democratic aide who was in the private meeting.	0
28hpo6	0	a	He has previously said that he would support an independent commission to investigate ties between Trump’s administration and Russia.	0
28nyt20	0	a	At a closed-door Democratic lunch on Thursday, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois urged party members to hold the line if he is selected.	0
28hpo5	0	a	He has no federal law enforcement experience and, while currently at a high-profile law firm, is most associated as a centrist Democrat.	0
28nyt23	0	a	The White House remains divided, and several senior officials expressed serious doubts about Mr. Lieberman.	0
28hpo21	0	a	“The FBI director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcement‎, prosecutors or the FBI itself ― not politicians,” Durbin told HuffPost later.	0
28nyt3	0	a	Mr. Lieberman, who served three terms in the Senate as a Democrat and one as an independent, would be an atypical choice to lead the F.B.I., whose agents prize the bureau’s independence as one of Washington’s few apolitical institutions.	0
28hpo14	0	a	It is rare for an FBI director to be appointed without the full backing of the Senate, Schatz noted.	0
28nyt18	0	a	He is also friendly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator, who has told Trump aides that Mr. Lieberman would most likely receive overwhelming support in the Senate.	0
28nyt27	0	a	Mr. Lieberman also has law enforcement experience as the former attorney general of Connecticut.	0
28fox10	1	a	"""Lieberman is probably the only person who can get 100 votes in the Senate,"" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said on Capitol Hill on Thursday after the closed Senate briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein."	1
28hpo8	0	a	Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called it a “mistake” to select an elected official to the post, saying that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official.	0
28hpo13	0	a	There are literally dozens of people who would get a unanimous vote.”	0
28hpo17	0	a	That absolutely includes Senator Lieberman.”	0
28nyt21	0	a	But casting Mr. Lieberman as the most likely choice did have one immediate advantage: It appealed to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had suggested this week that the firestorm over Mr. Trump’s ouster of Mr. Comey was as bad as Watergate.	0
28nyt9	0	a	“All over the world, no matter where you go, the F.B.I. is special.	0
28nyt4	0	a	Judges and former prosecutors, not elected officials, have frequently been chosen.	0
28nyt1	1	a	But members of Mr. Trump’s staff — alarmed by his rapid embrace of Mr. Lieberman, a charming 75-year-old political operator with no federal law enforcement experience — have quietly urged him to take more time to make such a critical hire.	1
28fox6	0	a	Lieberman, who ran as vice president on Al Gore's 2000 ticket, became an independent after losing the Democratic primary in 2006.	0
28hpo23	1	a	Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressed “great admiration” for the former senator, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) speculated that Lieberman could get 100 confirmation votes, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said he would be “overjoyed” if Lieberman, who is a friend of his, were picked.	1
28nyt11	1	a	It was unclear whether the president’s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the “Apprentice”-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate.	1
28fox1	0	a	Lieberman, 75, who served in the Senate from 1989-2013, first as a Democrat and then as an independent, met with Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss leading the law enforcement agency.	0
28nyt25	0	a	And he is employed by one of the firms where Marc E. Kasowitz, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, works, raising the prospect of conflict-of-interest accusations.	0
28nyt16	0	a	All three men are under consideration, the administration officials said, even if Mr. Lieberman, who was Al Gore’s running mate in the 2000 presidential campaign, is the front-runner.	0
28nyt15	0	a	It is not clear whether he will return to that role once Mr. Comey’s replacement is confirmed.	0
28nyt5	0	a	Administration officials described the search as fluid and said the president and his team were keeping the decision-making process closely held to avoid the leaks that Mr. Trump believes are endemic to the West Wing.	0
28hpo10	0	a	“There is no reason to appoint a politician to run the FBI,” Schatz said.	0
28hpo16	1	a	A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: “There couldn’t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician.	1
28hpo12	0	a	And more to the point, it is not as if there is no one else qualified to do this job.	0
28hpo24	0	a	“Joe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Democrat colleagues combined, so screw them,” McCain said of Democrats’ concerns.	0
28hpo25	1	a	The need for a new FBI director came after Trump fired Comey last week, a stunning move that occurred amid the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.	1
28fox2	0	a	A late and somewhat unlikely addition to Trump's short list, Lieberman is nonetheless the sudden frontrunner.	0
28hpo20	1	a	Not a one defended Lieberman.	1
28nyt19	0	a	Democrats pushed back hard on that notion, casting the conservative Mr. Lieberman as a Democrat in name only and noting that he publicly supported Mr. Trump’s pick of Michael T. Flynn as his first national security adviser.	0
28hpo15	0	a	And he speculated that a Lieberman nomination would split the chamber.	0
28hpo4	0	a	Lieberman, who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee before losing a primary bid for re-election and becoming an independent, would be an unconventional choice.	0
28fox5	0	a	Lieberman’s law enforcement experience stems from his two-term tenure as Connecticut’s attorney general, spanning from 1983 until his resignation in 1989 when he was elected to the U.S. Senate.	0
28hpo7	0	a	But it is his background in politics that had Democrats reacting with severe reservation.	0
28hpo22	0	a	Republicans, by contrast, praised Lieberman.	0
28hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump is “very close” to selecting an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, he told White House reporters on Thursday.	0

28nyt22	0	a	Mr. McCain defended Mr. Lieberman, who endorsed his 2008 run for president.	0

28nyt12	0	a	Mr. Trump is still seeking applicants, and some aides, along with many law enforcement officials, have suggested that he hire from within the agency to repair some of the damage to morale wrought by Mr. Comey’s sudden firing.	0
