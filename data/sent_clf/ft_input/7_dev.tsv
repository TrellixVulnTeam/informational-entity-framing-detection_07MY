11fox14	0	a	The partial closure of the government has led to hundreds of thousands of workers furloughed or working without pay, with groups representing the workers increasing their calls for D.C. to end the deadlock and get workers paid again. 	0
11hpo5	1	a	If funding for his border wall is not secured by the end of the negotiation period, Trump said he is prepared to shut down the government again or issue a national emergency declaration in order to get funding ― a plan that would strip funding from disaster recovery efforts.	1
11hpo4	1	a	The announcement comes on the 35th day of the longest shutdown in United States history and is a clear cave by Trump, whose impasse over the budget stems from his demands for $5.7 billion in funds for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ― a project Democratic lawmakers say is a firm deal-breaker.	1
11nyt51	0	a	As late as early Friday morning, Mr. Trump appeared intent on declaring a national emergency at the border alongside the agreement to reopen the government, but Mr. McConnell and White House officials encouraged him to drop the idea, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them.	0
11nyt29	0	a	He promised to ensure that workers would be compensated for the paychecks they have missed since the shutdown began in late December “very quickly or as soon as possible.”	0

11nyt34	1	a	And though the long-term economic damage caused by the shutdown remains to be seen, it appears that at the very least the short-term pain was more costly than a down payment on the border wall.	1
11nyt8	0	a	He conceded that “we do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea — we never did” and invoked the utility of “smart walls” that substitute some physical barriers for drones and other sensors.	0
11nyt30	0	a	To that effect, the Office of Management and Budget circulated a letter to affected agencies and departments on Friday afternoon instructing management to prepare for an “orderly reopening” and to prioritize pay and benefits for workers.	0
11nyt41	0	a	Few lawmakers even in the president’s own party saw it that way.	0
11nyt43	0	a	With polls showing the president enduring most of the blame by the public, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, pressured Mr. Trump to agree to the temporary truce.	0
11nyt46	0	a	A Democratic bill, which would have reopened the government with no strings attached, received more votes than the bill backed by Mr. Trump, which included temporary protections for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for his proposed border wall.	0
11hpo9	0	a	She was mum on whether she considered his proposal a final deal.	0
11nyt3	1	a	The plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.	1
11nyt1	0	a	The president’s concession paved the way for the House and the Senate to both pass a stopgap spending bill by voice vote.	0
11fox4	0	a	The deal appeared to include no money for a wall or steel barrier, but he said he hoped negotiations would continue to come to an agreement on wall funding.	0

11hpo7	0	a	Trump’s statement comes a day after the Senate failed to pass his proposal to reopen the government with border wall funding in exchange for temporary legal protection for some undocumented immigrants.	0
11nyt20	0	a	But Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated plainly that any compromise would not include money for a new border wall, which Democrats view as ineffective and overly costly even though many have supported border fencing in the past.	0
11nyt49	1	a	Mr. McConnell, who viewed the shutdown as unnecessary from the start, found Mr. Trump eager to end the impasse, and in a series of calls, they ironed out the details.	1

30fox5	0	a	"""They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title,"" she admitted."	0
30nyt2	0	a	As the official, Lois Lerner, appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, she sternly told her questioners that accusations that she had misled Congress in previous testimony were false.	0

30nyt32	1	a	“This administration, which told us and told the American people that the attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi was the work, was caused by a video, is now the same administration who expects us to believe that this scandal was just the result of two rogue agents in Cincinnati,” he said.	1
30fox21	0	a	"""I have not done anything wrong,"" she said."	0
30hpo14	0	a	“The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner’s lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,” Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement.	0
30fox14	0	a	The Christian Coalition won, but in one deposition, FEC lawyers asked a defendant if televangelist Pat Robertson prayed for him.	0

30hpo2	0	a	"""She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course,"" the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times."	0
30fox7	0	a	But just two days before the ABA conference, Lerner was specifically asked about the investigation.	0
30hpo13	0	a	"It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave ""false or misleading information"" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012."	0
30nyt36	0	a	One Democrat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, even raised the threat of appointing a special prosecutor if Congress continues to feel that the I.R.S. is not being straightforward.	0
30hpo4	1	a	"The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would ""have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her."""	1
30nyt28	0	a	Mr. George did shed some light on the extent of the accusations against the I.R.S., saying that at this point in this investigation he had no reason to believe any illegal conduct occurred.	0
30hpo5	0	a	The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting.	0
30nyt15	0	a	That exchange set the tone for a contentious hearing that veered into veiled accusations that the White House had a larger role in the controversy than previously disclosed, as well as outright attacks on President Obama’s character.	0
30hpo1	0	a	Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee.	0
30hpo15	0	a	“Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow’s hearing — the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight.	0

30nyt38	0	a	“There will be hell to pay if that’s the route we choose to go down.”	0
30nyt8	0	a	After she refused on Wednesday to say anything more to the committee, despite attempts by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committee’s Republican chairman, to persuade her otherwise, Mr. Issa tried to dismiss her and her lawyer.	0
30nyt33	0	a	“The people don’t buy it.”	0
30nyt1	0	a	She then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a House hearing on the agency’s actions.	0
30nyt43	0	a	In follow-up questioning by Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, Mr. Shulman offered what he said was one of the many plausible explanations why he would have visited the White House.	0
30nyt18	0	a	They argued that by making an opening statement, she had waived her Fifth Amendment right and could be compelled to testify, a contention Ms. Lerner’s lawyer disputed.	0
30fox0	0	a	The IRS official who refused to testify at a House hearing Wednesday has become a key focus of the congressional investigations into the IRS practice of singling out conservative groups.	0
30nyt7	0	a	An inspector general’s report found, however, that she was briefed on their actions as early as June 2011.	0
30nyt12	0	a	Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind.	0
30hpo9	0	a	As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria.	0
30nyt29	0	a	“We do not deem it illegal. We do not believe that it was illegal, what they did,” he said.	0
30nyt25	0	a	But Mr. Cummings also admonished his Republican colleagues.	0
30hpo8	0	a	Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal.	0
30fox16	0	a	"""Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment,"" he said."	0
30nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress.	0
30hpo12	0	a	Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee.	0
30nyt19	0	a	The committee also heard testimony from Douglas H. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner; Neal S. Wolin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department; and J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general who looked into the accusations of targeting.	0

30hpo0	0	a	Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports.	0
30fox3	0	a	Lerner touched off the public controversy when, at an American Bar Association conference earlier this month, she apologized for the IRS' practice of targeting conservative organizations for additional scrutiny.	0

69nyt1	0	a	WASHINGTON — In one of her final appearances as secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday vigorously defended her handling of last September’s attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans and prompted a scathing review of State Department procedures.	0
69fox10	0	a	And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004.	0

37nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund-raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, a military fight he called “a war of Obama’s choosing.”	0
37hpo11	0	a	Kristol’s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy. 	0
37nyt10	0	a	He added, “Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not ‘a war of Obama’s choosing.’	0
37fox13	0	a	"... And, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war."""	0
37hpo20	1	a	He is the figurehead of the Republican Party whose tenure, once again, seems shaky.	1
37hpo1	0	a	The pushback crested with Bill Kristol — still an influential voice among Republican lawmakers — writing a letter to Steele on his Weekly Standard site calling for the RNC leader’s resignation.	0
37nyt4	0	a	Mr. Steele, seeking to clarify his remarks, issued a statement on Friday afternoon, saying, “There is no question that America must win the war on terror.”	0
37nyt12	0	a	He added, “There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they’re certainly entitled to make their case.	0
37nyt1	0	a	“This is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in,” Mr. Steele said in a speech Thursday night in Connecticut in which he offered a strong critique of President Obama’s military strategy.	0
37nyt11	0	a	It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.”	0
37hpo12	0	a	But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone.	0
37nyt14	1	a	A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Brad Woodhouse, said Mr. Steele was “betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.”	1
37hpo6	0	a	And not on a trivial matter.	0
37nyt18	0	a	The video appears to have been taken by a hidden camera at an event that was closed to the press.	0
37hpo13	0	a	Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steele’s comments are “utterly irresponsible.”	0
37fox12	0	a	"Trying to quell the furor, Steele issued a statement saying: ""There is no question that America must win the war on terror."	0
37nyt19	0	a	Republican officials did not dispute the authenticity of the video, but disputed its characterization.	0
37hpo7	1	a	At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment.	1
37fox8	0	a	"He called Steele's comments ""unacceptable"" and ""inaccurate."""	0
37hpo0	0	a	Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. 	0
37nyt7	0	a	Mr. Obama shifted the focus on the war on terrorism from Iraq to Afghanistan and last year announced his plan to send 30,000 more troops there.	0
37nyt17	0	a	Linda McMahon, the party’s candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut, was in the audience, along with other leading state Republicans.	0
37hpo16	1	a	“It’s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,” summarized Senor. 	1
37fox4	0	a	"""This is America's war."	0
37hpo3	0	a	It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.	0
37nyt25	0	a	He added, with a reference to Gen. David H. Petraeus: “That is why I supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire United States Senate, I support General Petraeus’s confirmation.	0
37hpo9	0	a	There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they’re certainly entitled to make their case.	0
37nyt16	0	a	When Mr. Steele made the remarks, he was speaking to Republican contributors at a fund-raiser in Connecticut.	0
37nyt8	0	a	Mr. Steele’s comments prompted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and a leading voice of conservative support for the war in Afghanistan, to call for Mr. Steele’s resignation as party leader.	0
37nyt5	1	a	His remarks were the latest in a string of controversial statements that he has made as party chairman.	1
37hpo2	0	a	“Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not “a war of Obama’s choosing.”	0
37hpo21	0	a	Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steele’s troubles would spread far and wide.	0
37hpo19	0	a	But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit.	0
37hpo17	0	a	In a bit of irony, Steele’s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise.	0
37nyt15	0	a	Republican officials dismissed that criticism.	0
37hpo4	0	a	Republicans have consistently supported the effort.	0
37fox0	0	a	"Republican senators kept up pressure on party Chairman Michael Steele Sunday to better explain -- and publicly apologize for -- his on-camera claim that Afghanistan is a ""war of Obama's choosing"" and may not be winnable."	0
37nyt22	0	a	“For the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war,” Mr. Steele said.	0
37fox16	0	a	"Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge of conservatives calling for Steele to step down over the remark, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Steele still needs to go -- though he said Steele tried to convince him otherwise."	0
37nyt9	1	a	“Your tenure has, of course, been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, but I for one have never paid much attention to them, and have never thought they would matter much to the success of the causes and principles we share,” Mr. Kristol wrote Friday.	1
37hpo5	0	a	Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your statement “puts [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party.	0
37hpo10	0	a	But one of them shouldn’t be the chairman of the Republican party.”	0
37hpo15	0	a	Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is “’a war we have to win” — a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: “...you don’t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who’s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.” 	0
37fox14	0	a	"He sent an e-mail to RNC members saying he hoped his statement would ""clear up any confusion"" caused by his earlier remarks."	0
37nyt13	0	a	But one of them shouldn’t be the chairman of the Republican Party.”	0
37fox1	0	a	The backlash built quickly over the weekend as some prominent conservatives called for Steele's resignation.	0
37hpo14	1	a	Senor, who served under the Bush administration as chief spokesman in Iraq and has been a major booster of efforts to escalate U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, noted that Steele’s RNC actually sponsored a conference call for his group to praise Obama’s Afghan surge last year. 	1
37nyt2	1	a	“It was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq, while saying the battle really should be Afghanistan,” Mr. Steele said, according to a video of his remarks that was circulated by Democrats on Friday.	1
37nyt3	0	a	“Well, if he’s such a student of history, has he not understood that you know that’s the one thing you don’t do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?”	0
37nyt26	0	a	The stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in Afghanistan.”	0
37nyt6	0	a	The war in Afghanistan, which has entered its ninth year, was started by former President George W. Bush in response to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.	0
37fox2	0	a	"Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., would not go that far but said Steele must apologize to the troops."	0

37fox9	0	a	"""We need a chairman who's focused,"" DeMint said."	0
26nyt27	1	a	But the path to such a deal is murky at best.	1
26hpo22	0	a	But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment.	0
26nyt53	0	a	She noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks.	0
26nyt36	0	a	It was the president’s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall — and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.	0
26nyt8	0	a	“We’re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we’ll be able to reach an agreement,” Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.	0
26fox13	0	a	Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens. 	0

26hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new Congress on Wednesday with no end in sight.	0
26fox11	0	a	He offered some flexibility only on what the wall would be made of, saying it could be concrete or steel.	0
26nyt9	0	a	The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats — poised to assume control of the House on Thursday — who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump’s immigration policies.	0
26fox20	0	a	Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers. 	0
26hpo3	0	a	“They are now feeling the heat,” Schumer said.	0
26hpo23	0	a	Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it ― even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.	0
26hpo13	0	a	Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then.	0
26hpo27	0	a	Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump’s claims.	0
26nyt3	0	a	He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.	0
26nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting — the first in 22 days — could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump’s demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.	0
26nyt45	1	a	“Walls work,” he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one “around his compound” in Washington.	1
26nyt52	1	a	“This morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,” Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.	1
26fox24	1	a	As part of his strategy, he made available to every member a presentation on border security that he said those present at a meeting Wednesday did not want to hear.	1
26nyt12	0	a	“It’s too important a subject to walk away from.”	0
26nyt2	0	a	“I would look foolish if I did that,” Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity.	0
26nyt44	0	a	“The United States needs a physical barrier,” the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to “a sieve” that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.	0
26nyt34	0	a	Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.	0
26nyt50	0	a	Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.	0
26nyt32	0	a	The larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.	0
26nyt20	0	a	Mr. Trump’s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22.	0

26fox16	0	a	"Trump later said the group would ""determine what we're going to do about the border."" "	0
26fox15	0	a	Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend. 	0
26fox18	1	a	The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump’s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives. 	1
26nyt10	0	a	With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.	0
26hpo9	0	a	About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote.	0

26nyt35	0	a	Wednesday’s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion.	0
26nyt14	1	a	“He could not give a good answer,” Mr. Schumer said.	1
26nyt37	0	a	But it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.	0
26fox14	0	a	"She said there had been progress only in the sense of a ""better understanding"" of each other."	0
26hpo8	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.	0
26nyt21	0	a	It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.	0
26nyt13	0	a	Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: “We are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?”	0
26hpo1	0	a	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border.	0
26nyt11	0	a	“Could be a long time, or it could be quickly,” Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown.	0
