23nyt1	0	a	The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel’s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election.	0
23nyt15	0	a	Mr. Flynn’s legal troubles have only mounted in recent days.	0
23fox7	0	a	Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynn’s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents.	0
23fox8	0	a	Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge.	0
23hpo1	0	a	Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use “whatever compulsory process we need” to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas.	0
23nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, the committee’s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn’s troubles with Congress.	0
23nyt10	0	a	On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment’s protections against self-incrimination.	0
23hpo15	0	a	“There’s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there’s a very practical standard that has to be met,” Schiff said.	0
23nyt16	0	a	On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016.	0
23hpo11	0	a	“That could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,” Schiff said of Trump’s reported request to Coats and Rogers.	0
23fox3	0	a	"""A business does not have the right to take the fifth,"" Warner told reporters."	0
23hpo5	0	a	The House committee’s subpoenas “will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.	0
23nyt20	0	a	As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution.	0
23hpo9	0	a	Trump implied earlier this month that he had “tapes” of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey.	0
23hpo17	0	a	“If the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didn’t agree with, then you’re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,” Schiff said.	0
23hpo10	0	a	And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBI’s Russia investigation.	0
23nyt4	0	a	Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess.	0
23hpo2	0	a	He added that the committee could issue additional subpoenas if other witnesses fail to cooperate, but did not name additional individuals.	0
23nyt14	0	a	He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence.	0
23fox5	0	a	Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions.	0
23hpo13	0	a	“If all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, that’s something that we have to find out about and it’s something we have to stop,” he said.	0
23nyt18	0	a	During that trip, he was photographed at a gala sitting next to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.	0
23nyt3	0	a	“And I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.”	0
23nyt5	0	a	It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynn’s testimony, or both.	0
23hpo3	0	a	Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn’s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia’s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump’s associates.	0
23hpo8	0	a	The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump’s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.	0
23fox9	0	a	"""Everything is on the table,"" Burr said."	0
23hpo6	0	a	“We need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses … the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,” he added.	0
23hpo16	0	a	Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office.	0
23nyt21	0	a	Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee, has dismissed that option.	0
23hpo14	0	a	Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.	0
23hpo4	0	a	The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn’s businesses.	0
23nyt12	1	a	Mr. Flynn’s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation.	1
23nyt6	0	a	The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee.	0
23nyt9	0	a	The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynn’s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections.	0
23nyt2	0	a	“Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.	0
23nyt13	0	a	The Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign.	0
23hpo12	0	a	He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associates’ ties to Russia.	0
23nyt7	0	a	A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	0
23fox4	0	a	The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections.	0
23nyt19	0	a	Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.	0
23fox2	0	a	The committee's action comes a day after Flynn’s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committee’s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation.	0
23nyt11	0	a	He also declined the Senate committee’s invitation for an interview.	0
23hpo7	0	a	Schiff said he is “skeptical” that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.	0
23fox6	0	a	Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.	0
36fox3	0	a	Gowdy said Friday that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, has yet to adequately respond to the subpoena request for the server.	0
36nyt29	0	a	“We should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.”	0
36nyt18	0	a	Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya — and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clinton’s email practices — from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president.	0
36nyt2	0	a	He added that Mrs. Clinton’s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted “only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.”	0
36fox11	0	a	He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.	0
36nyt19	0	a	But the time frame in which he is asking Mrs. Clinton to submit to questioning — at any time before May 1 — coincides with the period in which she is widely expected to make her candidacy official.	0
36nyt15	0	a	“To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.”	0
36nyt1	0	a	Mrs. Clinton’s “email arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer Tuesday morning.	0
36nyt25	0	a	In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Priebus had overstepped his expertise.	0
36fox10	0	a	"""I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,” he said on Fox News' ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."""	0
36hpo4	0	a	An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate’s privacy and security for sensitive information.	0
36hpo10	1	a	Gowdy went on to call Clinton’s email situation “highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” and said it “exacerbates” lawmakers’ needs to “understand what the Secretary did.”	1
36hpo11	1	a	Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she “thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.”	1
36nyt24	0	a	“There are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.”	0
36nyt26	1	a	“As far as I know, he’s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,” Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus.	1
36nyt28	0	a	“We don’t know enough facts, so why speculate?” Mr. Gowdy added.	0
36nyt23	1	a	“Even Nixon didn’t destroy the tapes,” Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation.	1
36nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.	0
36fox4	1	a	He said the committee learned she had “unilaterally decided” to wipe it clean and permanently delete all emails.	1
36nyt16	0	a	The committee’s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview.	0
36fox0	0	a	"The congressional committee probing the Benghazi attacks has formally requested that Hillary Clinton appear for an interview on her use of a personal email and server for official business while secretary of state, after learning the server had been wiped ""clean."""	0
36nyt4	0	a	But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.	0
36hpo2	0	a	“Toward that end and because of the Secretary’s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy stated in the letter.	0
36fox6	0	a	Earlier this month, Clinton acknowledged that she sent or received roughly 60,000 related emails, turning over roughly half to the State Department and deleting about the same number of “personal” ones.	0
36nyt11	0	a	Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that “a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.”	0
36nyt6	0	a	The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clinton’s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private.	0
36hpo13	0	a	Clinton is not the only government official to use a private email for work.	0
36fox9	0	a	"Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have ""separate conversations"" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server."	0
36nyt20	0	a	Some Republicans on Capitol Hill — including Mr. Gowdy — are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue.	0
36nyt13	0	a	In a written statement, a spokesman for her said she had told the committee months ago that she was prepared to testify at a public hearing.	0
36hpo7	0	a	Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.	0
36fox8	0	a	“The committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,” Gowdy also wrote in the letter.	0
36fox2	0	a	"Gowdy asked that Clinton agree to a ""transcribed"" interview -- and repeated a March 16 request for her to surrender her server so it can be examined by the State Department’s inspector general."	0
36hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi sent a formal interview request to Hillary Clinton’s lawyer on Tuesday regarding emails she exchanged during her time as secretary of state.	0
36nyt3	0	a	The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department’s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.	0
36fox12	0	a	Clinton has not yet announced a presidential bid.	0
36hpo12	1	a	She admitted that “looking back,” it would have been better to carry the second phone.	1
36nyt21	1	a	On Monday, Mr. Priebus said in an appearance on Fox News that Mrs. Clinton’s decision to delete her emails “is criminal in nature.”	1
36nyt27	1	a	“And I’m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.”	1
36hpo8	0	a	“We share the Secretary’s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary’s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,” Gowdy said.	0
36nyt17	0	a	“Rather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,” he said.	0
36hpo6	0	a	Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean.	0
36hpo3	0	a	Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.	0
36nyt8	1	a	Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.	1
36fox1	0	a	Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer.	0
36nyt22	0	a	“I mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,” Mr. Priebus said on “Fox and Friends.”	0
36nyt10	0	a	But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “will remain private.”	0
36fox7	0	a	The South Carolina Republican set a deadline of May 1 for the interview and restated the committee is interested only in the deleted emails relating to Clinton’s response as secretary of state to the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed.	0
36hpo1	0	a	In a letter to the Clinton’s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to “Libya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.”	0
36nyt5	0	a	In October, the State Department asked former secretaries of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide it with any government records — like emails — they might have in their possession.	0
36hpo14	0	a	Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said he used a private email during his time in office, as did Jeb Bush when he served as governor of Florida.	0
36nyt7	0	a	Then, he said, a setting on the email account was changed to retain only messages sent in the previous two months.	0
36nyt12	0	a	But Mrs. Clinton indicated on Tuesday that she wanted to give her testimony in a public setting.	0
36hpo5	0	a	The request comes after reports revealed Clinton used a private email address and a server located in her New York home during her time as secretary of state.	0
36fox5	0	a	“This committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy wrote to Clinton attorney David Kendall on Tuesday.	0

62nyt11	0	a	Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday.	0
62fox4	0	a	"He called the disclosure of the program that allows the NSA to collect communications data from Internet companies ""reprehensible"" and said the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation's intelligence gathering activities."	0

62fox10	0	a	"Several hours earlier, a senior administration official also pushed back, saying the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that ""does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States.”"	0

62nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an “internal government computer system” designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009.	0
62fox25	0	a	To be immune from lawsuits, companies like Yahoo and AOL are reportedly obliged to accept a directive from the attorney general and national intelligence director to open their service to the FBI's Data Intercept Technology Unit, which acts as a liaison between the companies and the NSA.	0
62nyt23	0	a	“Now that the fact of bulk collection has been declassified, we believe that more information about the scale of the collection, and specifically whether it involves the records of ‘millions of Americans,’ should be declassified as well,” they said.	0
62hpo19	1	a	The president's full-throated defense of the programs, albeit with the qualification that he welcomes debate, is unlikely to quell the outrage over the revelations.	1
62hpo6	0	a	The Guardian reported Wednesday that the National Security Agency had obtained a court order to collect phone records from Verizon Wireless customers, while The Washington Post reported Thursday of the existence of a program launched in 2007 called PRISM, which tracks information from nine leading U.S. Internet companies: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL, YouTube, Apple, PalTalk and Skype.	0

62hpo3	1	a	"""These are programs that have been authored by large bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006."""	1
62nyt4	0	a	Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government “does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers” of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a “documented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisition” of the data.	0
62nyt12	0	a	The administration, by disclosing the briefings, sought to push back on claims by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that they were either not aware of programs to mine vast amounts of Internet data and business telephone records or were insufficiently briefed on the details.	0
62fox17	0	a	The official told Fox News that the Utah Data Center is likely a repository for this material.	0
62fox16	0	a	Metadata from the companies is used to identify suspicious individuals and the secondary search goes into content.	0

70fox5	0	a	But the address was stitched together, more broadly, by an appeal for a “new national pride” and a rediscovery of American patriotism, as he described this as a salve for the country’s divisions.	0
70nyt56	0	a	From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump’s election.	0
