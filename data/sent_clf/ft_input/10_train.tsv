12nyt0	0	a	Report Sees Guns as Path to Safety in Schools	0
12nyt18	0	a	At least one state, Indiana, is considering the idea of armed officers at schools.	0
12nyt5	0	a	He cited a 1997 Mississippi case in which an assistant principal ran to his truck to retrieve a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol and subdued a gunman who had killed two students.	0

12nyt17	1	a	That’s what we need.”	1
12hpo19	1	a	The speech was widely considered a public relations disaster.	1
12nyt12	0	a	But critics see no distinction between the two.	0
12hpo28	0	a	When he had finished introducing the report, Hutchinson called up Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James Mattioli, was killed in December along with 19 other children at Sandy Hook Elementary School.	0
12hpo22	0	a	"Asked about the current debate in Congress over gun control legislation, Hutchinson said he had ""not dealt with the separate debate"" because he had been too busy considering school safety issues."	0
12hpo12	0	a	Other recommendations included creating threat assessment teams at schools, better coordinating state and federal funding for school security, and offering an online assessment tool, so that administrators can evaluate their schools' potential security gaps.	0
12hpo1	0	a	WASHINGTON -- Former Rep. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) on Tuesday released a 225-page report on school safety funded by the National Rifle Association.	0
12nyt14	0	a	But the report did get support from at least one Newtown parent: Mark Mattioli, whose 6-year-old son, James, was killed.	0
12nyt19	0	a	On Tuesday, a proposal that would require public and charter schools to have an armed “protection officer” on school property during class hours passed a State House committee.	0
12nyt22	0	a	The group also called on states to require schools to develop security plans.	0
12fox12	0	a	While a few have focused on school security -- South Dakota has already approved legislation allowing for teachers to be armed -- many have concentrated on enacting or expanding assault weapons bans, strengthening background checks and passing other measures to restrict access to firearms.	0
12fox2	0	a	The NRA initially took criticism from Democrats for focusing so closely on school security, and rejecting gun control measures, following the Connecticut shooting in which 26 people were killed.	0
12hpo6	0	a	"He added that the report found that ""local school authorities are in the best position"" to determine their own school security measures, ""specifically whether an armed security guard is necessary and supported by the education and citizen community."""	0
12hpo2	0	a	"The report, commissioned in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, recommended properly trained armed employees to provide ""an important layer of security in schools."""	0
12fox7	0	a	"""This is not talking about all teachers,"" he said."	0

12hpo16	1	a	"The NRA said it needs ""time to digest"" the findings, but it commended Hutchinson and his team for contributions that ""will go a long way to making America's schools safer."""	1
12fox11	0	a	The review comes as Congress and a number of state legislatures pursue gun control legislation.	0
12nyt21	0	a	It recommended that officers or employees who are armed take a 40- to 60-hour training course to be developed by the rifle association based on a model the task force has designed.	0
12hpo26	0	a	"So if you're going to protect children, you have to do something about enhancing school safety,"" he said."	0
12nyt13	1	a	Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children’s Defense Fund, an advocacy group here, criticized the study as “nothing more than a continuation of the N.R.A.’s attempts to prey on America’s fears, saturate our schools with more guns and turn them into armed fortresses.”	1
12nyt10	0	a	After the Newtown shooting, Wayne LaPierre, the rifle association’s executive director, announced that it would devise a plan to put armed guards in every school.	0
12hpo10	0	a	The task force also suggested that states loosen current legal restrictions on who can carry a firearm on school property.	0
12nyt8	0	a	“The one before that was in a shopping mall in Oregon, and the one before that was in a movie theater in Colorado.	0
12hpo24	0	a	"Hutchinson called them ""totally inadequate."""	0
12nyt3	1	a	A dozen officers in plain clothes and uniforms stood watch as he spoke; one warned photographers to “remain stationary” during the event.	1
12nyt4	0	a	Among the study’s central conclusions is that “the presence of armed security personnel adds a layer of security and diminishes response time” in a shooting, Mr. Hutchinson said.	0
12fox14	0	a	But LaPierre in December argued that improving school security is paramount.	0
12hpo17	0	a	The report marks the culmination of a controversial process that began in December, when NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre held a press conference the week after the shooting in Newtown, Conn.	0
12nyt1	0	a	WASHINGTON — With the Senate set to debate gun control this month, a National Rifle Association task force released a 225-page report on Tuesday that called for armed police officers, security guards or staff members in every American school, and urged states to loosen gun restrictions to allow trained teachers and administrators to carry weapons.	0
12hpo29	1	a	"Mattioli praised the NRA ""for coming up and spending the time and resources on putting a program like this together."""	1
12hpo0	0	a	NRA School Safety Report Recommends Arming Teachers, Loosening Gun Laws	0
12hpo23	0	a	He did, however, weigh in on state gun control efforts currently being debated in Connecticut, which include a ban on high-capacity magazines and a broader assault weapons ban.	0
12nyt27	0	a	Mr. Obama is pushing for a measure that would impose mandatory background checks for gun buyers, and the Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, has promised to present a bill that would expand background checks to the floor for a vote.	0
12fox4	0	a	"Former Arkansas Rep. Asa Hutchinson, who led the NRA's review, appeared to ease off slightly on the call for armed officers in every school -- he said it's ""important"" for every school to have at least one, but acknowledged these decisions are ""locally made"" based on unique budget circumstances."	0
12fox15	0	a	He argued that if banks and members of Congress can have protection, schools across America should be afforded the same security.	0
12nyt15	0	a	“I think politics needs to be set aside here, and I hope this doesn’t lead to name-calling,” said Mr. Mattioli, who joined Mr. Hutchinson at the news conference.	0
12nyt23	1	a	But how and whether the task force recommendations will be put into effect — and the cost — was unclear.	1
12hpo27	0	a	Hutchinson also encouraged the NRA to continue funding pilot programs to train school employees to carry weapons.	0
12fox1	0	a	The National Rifle Association called Tuesday for state legislatures to allow more school personnel to carry weapons on school grounds once they've gone through extensive training, as part of a set of recommendations that capped a weeks-long review in the wake of the Newtown mass shooting.	0
12hpo18	0	a	At the time, LaPierre assailed the media and gun control advocates for their responses to the massacre, and he proposed that armed volunteers protect schools and that gun-free school zones be eliminated.	0
12nyt25	1	a	President Obama has called for tough new controls on gun ownership, but the prospects for such legislation are murky — a testimony to the rifle association’s prowess as a lobbying force.	1
12hpo15	0	a	The NRA also put out a statement on the report, over which the gun lobby insists it had no influence.	0
12hpo3	0	a	The report was prepared by a 12-person task force, called the School Shield Program, led by Hutchinson.	0
12nyt11	0	a	Technically, Mr. Hutchison’s task force is independent of the rifle association, even though it paid for the study, and Mr. LaPierre was not present on Tuesday.	0
12nyt7	0	a	“Arming the teacher is merely a response to the last tragedy,” said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat who is chairman of a House task force on gun violence.	0
12nyt24	0	a	The timing of Tuesday’s announcement was not a coincidence: Congress will wrap up its spring recess after this week and is expected to consider gun legislation after lawmakers return.	0
12hpo4	0	a	At Tuesday's press conference, he stated that its findings were independent of the nation's largest gun lobby.	0
12fox6	0	a	"To accompany that, his group proposed a ""model"" state law that would allow certain personnel who have undergone this training to carry weapons on school grounds."	0
12hpo21	0	a	But the recommendation that states allow non-law enforcement officers, such as teachers and principals, to carry guns in schools would essentially eliminate gun-free school zones.	0
12hpo13	0	a	Hutchinson's report and his press conference were both met with scathing criticism from the American Federation of Teachers, which supports broader gun control measures and strongly opposes arming educators.	0
12hpo5	0	a	"""Teachers should teach, but if there is personnel that has interest and is willing to go through 40 to 60 hours of [firearms] training, then schools should be willing to [arm them],"" Hutchinson said."	0
12hpo7	0	a	The task force recommended that schools designate willing staff to be armed and trained, and it proposed a model training program, 40-60 hours per person, at what Hutchinson said would be a cost of about $800 to $1,000 per trained employee.	0
12hpo25	0	a	"""You can address assault weapons, but it doesn't stop violence in schools."	0
12hpo20	1	a	"Hutchinson said Tuesday that the idea of armed volunteers was scrapped after it was met with ""great reluctance"" from school employees."	1
12fox8	0	a	"""Teachers should teach."""	0
12fox18	0	a	"He added: ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun."""	0
12hpo9	0	a	"The committee didn't recommend any specific kind of firearm for school security, Hutchinson said, adding, ""Everything from a sidearm, to a shotgun, to an AR-15"" would work."	0
12nyt9	1	a	I don’t think the proper response is to arm all the projectionists in the movie theaters or all the vendors in the mall.”	1
12fox13	0	a	Connecticut, the home of the Sandy Hook school shooting, is the latest to advance a sweeping gun control proposal -- lawmakers announced a deal Monday on a package that is likely to win approval.	0
12nyt2	1	a	Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican congressman from Arkansas who led the task force, unveiled the report at a packed news conference with unusually heavy security, including a bomb-sniffing yellow Labrador retriever.	1
12nyt6	0	a	The recommendations — which also included expanding the police presence in schools — drew immediate criticism from gun control advocates and many Democrats, who have been fighting to tighten gun restrictions after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December.	0
12fox0	0	a	NRA urges states to allow more armed officers in schools	0
12nyt20	0	a	The task force panel called on the Departments of Homeland Security, Education and Justice to coordinate school safety efforts and provide grant money for schools to assess their ability to prevent and respond to attacks.	0
12fox10	1	a	Mark Mattioli, the father of one Newtown shooting victim, also spoke after Hutchinson's announcement to applaud the review effort.	1
12hpo14	1	a	"In a statement, union President Randi Weingarten called the report ""a cruel hoax that will fail to keep our children and schools safe,"" adding that the findings ""are simply designed to assist gun manufacturers flood the nation and our schools with more guns."""	1
12fox3	0	a	NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre in December called for armed officers to be installed in every school in the country.	0
12fox17	0	a	"""The only way to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be permanently involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection."""	0
12nyt26	0	a	A plan to revive and revamp a ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004, is almost certain to be defeated.	0
12hpo8	0	a	"Armed school personnel, called school resource officers, would also be required to undergo a ""background investigation, testing, and [have] relevant experience."""	0
12hpo11	0	a	Many states currently prohibit anyone but a law enforcement officer from possessing guns in a school.	0

14nyt0	0	a	FERGUSON, Mo. — Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. arrived in St. Louis on Wednesday, meeting with community leaders and federal investigators even as local law enforcement officials said they were hopeful that they had turned a corner in calming the restive community of Ferguson after 12 days of protests and unrest.	0
14nyt32	0	a	Then a curfew was imposed. The next night, there was no curfew.	0
14nyt14	0	a	By failing to act, Mr. McCulloch said, the governor “undermines everything except the cover he has pulled over his head.”	0
14fox22	0	a	A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch said there was no timeline for the process, but it could take weeks.	0
14hpo41	0	a	In addition to Ferguson community members, Holder spent Wednesday meeting with officials from the St. Louis-based U.S. attorney's office and the local FBI office investigating Brown's death.	0
14nyt43	1	a	When a demonstration ended shortly before midnight, many of the demonstrators prayed.	1
14nyt6	0	a	A grand jury has been convened and was scheduled to meet Wednesday to begin hearing evidence, said Edward Magee, a spokesman for Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.	0
14fox6	0	a	The attorney general then described how he was stopped twice on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding.	0
14nyt5	0	a	As the tension on the street seemed to ease, the focus turned to the investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown.	0
14nyt25	0	a	In addition to the many lingering questions about the shooting, the local authorities have also come under criticism for how they have handled the protests.	0
14fox25	0	a	McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect.	0
14nyt24	0	a	In a sign of just how deep the distrust runs, there were three separate autopsies performed on Mr. Brown’s body: one by the county medical examiner, one by a private pathologist hired by the family, and one by federal authorities.	0
14nyt37	0	a	On Tuesday night, however, it seemed that some of that energy had gone from the streets.	0
14nyt34	0	a	The National Guard was finally brought in to try to temper the unrest, but its role was not exactly clear.	0
14nyt12	0	a	But he acknowledged that Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri has the power to appoint a new prosecutor.	0

14hpo17	0	a	Some people were told that they would be meeting with an official from the Justice Department, but not that it was Holder.	0
14nyt29	1	a	He reserved his harshest criticism for the use of tear gas by the police — a mistake he said he made in Seattle and one he regrets to this day.	1
14fox14	0	a	While in Ferguson, Holder met with federal officials investigating the case, as well as Brown's parents.	0
14hpo5	0	a	Dominique McCoy, who attended the smaller meeting, told The Huffington Post that Holder said change wouldn't happen overnight.	0

14hpo18	0	a	The owners of the restaurant said they were informed of the event only about an hour ahead of time.	0
14fox1	0	a	Holder made the comments during a meeting with about 50 community leaders at the Florissant campus of St. Louis Community College in which he heard about their own issues with law enforcement officials.	0
14nyt44	0	a	“Now that’s what I call a good protest,” Jonathan Smith, 45, said.	0
14nyt8	0	a	They argued that he could not be impartial because his father, a police officer, was shot and killed by a black man while on duty when Mr. McCulloch was a child.	0
14fox27	1	a	On Wednesday, police said an officer had been suspended for pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at demonstrators, then cursing and threatening to kill one of them.	1
14nyt22	0	a	“And beyond the investigation itself, we will work with the police, civil rights leaders, and members of the public to ensure that this tragedy can give rise to new understanding — and robust action — aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve.”	0
14fox24	0	a	McCulloch's deep family connections to police have been cited by some black leaders who question his ability to be impartial in the case.	0
14nyt11	0	a	He said he has only one interest: conducting a fair and thorough investigation.	0
14fox21	0	a	In nearby Clayton, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether Wilson should be charged in Brown's death.	0

14nyt31	0	a	On one day, protesters were told to gather in one place. Another day, they were told to keep moving.	0
14nyt35	0	a	“You get governors and police chiefs and everyone gnashing their teeth,” Mr. Stamper said.	0
14nyt41	0	a	In some instances, teams of officers abruptly entered the crowd, detained a single person whom they had apparently focused on, and returned to West Florissant Avenue, where many of the recent confrontations have occurred.	0
14nyt13	0	a	“Anyone who wants me off the case needs to call up the governor and express their opinion to him,” Mr. McCulloch told KTRS radio.	0
14nyt40	0	a	The authorities made at least 47 arrests after demonstrators tossed bottles toward police officers, some of whom used pepper spray to subdue some protesters.	0
14hpo24	0	a	After the meeting, attendees said they were thankful that Holder and the federal government were paying attention to Ferguson’s problems.	0
14hpo22	0	a	Soon, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who has earned some praise since he took over policing of Ferguson's nightly protests, stopped by to greet the attorney general.	0
14nyt33	0	a	The local police were in control; then another unit took over.	0
14fox0	0	a	Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that he understands why many black Americans distrust the police as he made a one-day swing through the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., where a black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer almost two weeks earlier.	0
14nyt4	0	a	Still, the police did make 47 arrests overnight.	0
14fox4	0	a	"""I understand that mistrust,"" Holder said."	0
14nyt10	0	a	“I know the pain the Brown family is going through right now,” he said.	0
14nyt38	0	a	And the police also seemed more restrained, refraining from using tear gas.	0
14fox7	0	a	Police searched his car, going through the trunk and looking under the seats.	0
14nyt27	1	a	“The basic perspective that I have over this whole thing, dating back to the shooting incident itself, what we had were largely peaceful vigils and protests that were met with police tactics that were highly aggressive and militaristic,” he said.	1
14fox17	0	a	On Wednesday night, a diminished number of protesters marched around a single block in Ferguson as a thunderstorm filled the sky with lighting and dumped rain.	0
14nyt19	0	a	More than 40 F.B.I. agents have been dispatched to Ferguson, and Mr. Holder said they are not only investigating the shooting but also looking for any broad patterns of civil rights violations.	0
14fox15	0	a	He also met with Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of security in Ferguson for nearly a week.	0
14nyt20	0	a	In an open letter to the people of Ferguson, Mr. Holder said he understood the desire of residents for an “independent” inquiry.	0
14nyt9	0	a	Mr. McCulloch, speaking to a local radio station, categorically rejected that notion.	0
14nyt1	0	a	Mr. Holder’s first stop was at a community college, where he met with people who told him about their own personal experiences with the local police, some of which they said helped fuel the rage that was ultimately ignited by the shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer on Aug. 9.	0
14nyt39	0	a	The evening began in a familiar fashion: Demonstrators marched along the street and chanted “Hands up! Don’t shoot!” and other slogans that have become common here since Mr. Brown’s death.	0
14nyt42	0	a	Although law enforcement officers in riot gear eyed the protesters while a police helicopter occasionally circled the city, there were no signs of trouble for long stretches of the evening.	0
14nyt3	0	a	Captain Johnson, whose agency is overseeing security here, said there were only sporadic problems on Tuesday night, and none of the wide-scale looting and confrontations that had erupted on other nights.	0
14nyt21	0	a	“This is my pledge to the people of Ferguson: Our investigation into this matter will be full, it will be fair, and it will be independent,” Mr. Holder wrote in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.	0
14fox13	0	a	"At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor. I wasn't a kid,"" he said."	0
14hpo13	0	a	"""I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me,"" Holder said."	0
14hpo35	0	a	At the community college, Holder said that they were starting “a good dialogue” but that it was “not enough.”	0
14nyt2	0	a	There were more protests planned throughout the day and into the evening, but Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said he believed they had reached “a turning point.”	0

21nyt15	0	a	The suit does not specifically seek to overturn the portion of Amendment 64 that made marijuana legal for personal use and possession, meaning that portions of legalization could survive even if Nebraska and Oklahoma prevail.	0
21nyt6	0	a	Oklahoma and Nebraska said the influx had led to more arrests, more impounded vehicles and higher jail and court costs.	0
21nyt18	0	a	The lawsuit, which was brought by Nebraska’s attorney general, Jon Bruning, and Oklahoma’s attorney general, Scott Pruitt, accused Colorado officials of participating in a “scheme” that cultivates, packages and distributes marijuana in direct violation of controlled-substances laws while “ignoring every objective embodied in the federal drug control regulation.”	0

40hpo40	1	a	“There seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,” Gillespie said.	1
40nyt20	0	a	When Mr. Biden went after Mr. Romney’s infamous remark at a private fund-raiser about the “47 percent,” Mr. Ryan reminded the vice president of his own propensity for gaffes.	0
40hpo5	0	a	Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive.	0
40nyt10	0	a	“I know you’re under duress,” he told the vice president, prompting another belly laugh.	0
40fox40	0	a	"On abortion, he cautioned that the next president will get to choose one or two justices on the Supreme Court -- ""that's how close Roe v. Wade is."""	0
40hpo11	0	a	"Obama adviser David Axelrod said ""Andrew is a unique thinker, and I can't speak for how he might react to this."	0
40hpo48	0	a	One of Ryan’s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments.	0
40hpo46	0	a	Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago.	0
40hpo15	0	a	Passion was the thing Obama lacked last week, and Romney surprised the president and Democrats by talking constantly about how his policies would help the middle class.	0
40hpo24	0	a	The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas.	0
40nyt28	0	a	A version of this article appears in print on October 12, 2012, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Night of Withering Ripostes, Mostly Delivered by Biden.	0
40hpo45	0	a	Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else.	0
40hpo27	1	a	"After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: ""That's a bunch of malarkey."""	1
40hpo34	1	a	Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: “Ryan: serious, sober, steady.	1
40nyt11	1	a	For Mr. Biden especially, the night was his chance to relive past debates and unleash his inner barroom brawler.	1
40hpo50	0	a	And he then added: “With respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.”	0
40hpo55	0	a	Show me something. Show me a policy,” Biden said.	0
40nyt5	0	a	The vice presidential debate on Tuesday was supposed to be a reboot for the Obama campaign after the president’s dismal performance at his debate with the Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, last week.	0
40hpo41	0	a	The Obama campaign, of course, relished in Republicans’ focus on Biden’s behavior instead of the substance of his remarks.	0
40fox46	0	a	"Obama has acknowledged he had a ""bad night"" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward."	0
40nyt24	0	a	Martha Raddatz of ABC News was the moderator, and she made a point of speaking forcefully, pushing the candidates to be specific and changing subjects abruptly.	0
40nyt1	0	a	Lloyd Bentsen was a friend of Joe Biden’s.	0
40fox49	0	a	The next one will be a town hall format focusing on a range of issues, and the last one will focus exclusively on foreign policy.	0
40hpo2	0	a	What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out.	0
40hpo3	0	a	Two instant surveys of Americans watching the debate -- one by CBS, one by CNN -- showed mixed results.	0
40fox4	1	a	He chuckled and smirked through many of Ryan's responses.	1
40fox43	0	a	"But we're not getting leadership,"" he said."	0
40nyt12	0	a	He had to be contained and courteous when he debated Sarah Palin four years ago, lest he look like a bully.	0
40nyt22	0	a	Mr. Biden was not quite as amused.	0
40fox15	0	a	There are two more presidential debates on the calendar, and the polls have started to swing in Romney's favor.	0
40hpo30	1	a	If it were anyone other than Biden, who is treated by the press as a lovable, half-crazy uncle, he would have been labeled insufferable.	1
40hpo9	1	a	It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -– and buck up -– worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate.	1
40fox30	0	a	"On the question of why the administration initially claimed the attack was the result of a protest, Biden explained ""the intelligence community told us that."""	0
40hpo17	0	a	“I think the way the vice president handled himself was condescending,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).	0
40fox44	0	a	In a matter of days, Romney has picked up steam in both battleground and national polls.	0
40hpo44	0	a	"And that's what happened tonight: they lost the debate."""	0
40fox37	0	a	"Ryan shot back: ""They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare."""	0
40fox23	0	a	They first blamed the YouTube video.	0
40fox9	0	a	"Ryan shot back, in reference to Biden's tendency to make gaffes: ""As the vice president very well knows ... sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way."""	0
40hpo21	0	a	"""These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden."	0
40nyt27	0	a	It wasn’t the best example to use, because it prompted Mr. Biden to describe his own tragedy, when his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash.	0
40hpo31	0	a	Instead, he got the aggressive label.	0
40nyt15	1	a	His interruptive barrage was as relentless as his silent mugging for the camera.	1
40hpo42	0	a	"""Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics,"" said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina."	0
40nyt3	0	a	Mr. Ryan was no Dan Quayle, but he did make the mistake of mentioning John F. Kennedy in an argument over whether tax cuts recharge the economy.	0
40hpo60	0	a	The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan’s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.	0
40nyt23	0	a	Mr. Biden was not the only one in the room intent on rectifying his predecessor’s mistakes.	0
40hpo23	0	a	Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election.	0
40hpo47	0	a	"He raised the issue of Romney’s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could “never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."""	0
40fox8	0	a	"""These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,"" Biden said, adding he's ""had it up to here"" with those kinds of comments."	0
40fox29	0	a	"Biden also criticized Romney for making a ""political statement""on the night of the attack, a reference to Romney's criticism of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo's early response to protests there."	0
40fox33	0	a	Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.	0
40fox5	1	a	But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged.	1
40nyt17	0	a	“On two occasions, we — we — we advocated for constituents who were applying for grants,” Mr. Ryan said stiffly.	0
40fox0	0	a	In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions.	0
40fox16	0	a	The tightening was reflected in the candidates' attitude onstage Thursday, each loath to give the other too many seconds of speech-time without a challenge.	0
40fox6	1	a	Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not.	1
40hpo35	1	a	Biden: smirking, mocking, immature.”	1
40nyt2	0	a	And the vice president made full use of his old Senate colleague’s 1988 debate playbook, shaking his head and scoffing pityingly at Representative Paul D. Ryan, trying to paint his opponent as a latter-day Dan Quayle.	0
40fox1	0	a	The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes.	0
40hpo25	0	a	But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard.	0
40fox27	1	a	"... Not a single thing he said is accurate."""	1
40fox18	0	a	Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody.	0
40fox13	0	a	"""This is not what a real recovery looks like,"" Ryan said."	0
40nyt0	0	a	Joe Biden knew Lloyd Bentsen.	0
40hpo32	0	a	Republicans thought it was much more than that.	0
40fox47	0	a	"After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a ""happy warrior"" for the middle class."	0
40hpo22	1	a	Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years.	1
40fox21	0	a	With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack.	0
40hpo13	1	a	"Sullivan, for the record, called the night ""a solid win for Biden"" and called Ryan ""competent."""	1
40fox28	0	a	"He added: ""This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about."""	0
40hpo29	0	a	At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought.	0
40hpo37	0	a	“Most people probably found the vice president’s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,” said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.	0
40hpo38	0	a	But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.	0
40fox38	0	a	The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail.	0
40hpo4	0	a	But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week.	0
40nyt21	0	a	“I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don’t come out of your mouth the right way,” he said with a gotcha smile.	0
40hpo39	0	a	“I don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,” Gillespie said.	0
40nyt26	0	a	Mr. Ryan made a point of praising Mr. Romney, even trying to soften his image by recounting a time when Mr. Romney gave money and attention to a couple whose children were badly injured in a car accident.	0
40hpo52	1	a	Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts.	1
40hpo56	0	a	Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.	0
40hpo28	1	a	"""Not a single thing he said is accurate,"" Biden said."	1
40fox10	0	a	"""But I always say what I mean,"" Biden responded."	0
40fox41	0	a	"Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a ""debt crisis is coming"" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit."	0
40nyt19	0	a	“This was such a bad program, and he writes me a letter saying — writes the Department of Energy a letter saying, the reason we need this stimulus — it will create growth and jobs.”	0
40fox7	0	a	"Notably, he hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly videotaped comment in which he said he doesn't have to worry about the ""47 percent"" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes."	0
40hpo20	0	a	Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.	0
40hpo33	0	a	Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Miller called Biden “unhinged.”	0
40hpo49	0	a	Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring.	0
40hpo0	1	a	DANVILLE, Ky. –- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more.	1
40nyt6	0	a	Mr. Biden, clearly delighted to come to President Obama’s rescue, relished his role, addressing his opponent as “my friend” but dismissing his arguments as “malarkey.”	0
40fox26	1	a	"Biden was quick to retort: ""With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey."	1
40hpo26	0	a	It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president.	0
40hpo53	1	a	But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides.	1
40fox32	0	a	After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge.	0
40hpo16	0	a	By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans.	0
40fox42	0	a	"""That's what we get in this administration -- speeches."	0
40hpo8	0	a	“He had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate.	0
40hpo57	0	a	Biden didn’t worry so much about numbers.	0
40hpo19	1	a	When my 11-year-old tries to do that at the dinner table, it’s not tolerated.”	1
40hpo51	0	a	Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.	0
40hpo12	0	a	"I hope he is [reassured],"" Axelrod said, adding that he had ""high regard for [Sullivan] by the way."""	0
40fox35	0	a	"On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto ""voucher"" system."	0
40nyt13	0	a	This time he let loose.	0
40nyt8	0	a	It was a sharp and spirited debate, with both candidates delivering some lacerating blows, but Mr. Ryan at times seemed disconcerted by the sheer blowhard intensity Mr. Biden brought to the night.	0
40fox20	0	a	"""What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,"" Ryan said."	0
40fox17	0	a	The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central.	0
40fox45	0	a	The latest Fox News national poll of likely voters showed Romney edging Obama, 46 percent to 45 percent.	0
40hpo18	0	a	“He was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people.	0
40hpo59	0	a	He acknowledged that Romney’s Medicare plan would not cost seniors an extra $6,400 a year, despite the claim in a recently launched Obama campaign ad.	0
40fox22	0	a	"""This is becoming more troubling by the day."	0
40hpo1	0	a	The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.	0
40hpo43	0	a	"""You're going to do that when you've lost a debate."	0
40fox25	0	a	Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected.	0
40hpo58	0	a	Biden’s argument on Medicare was aimed at voters’ guts, much more so than minds.	0
40fox36	0	a	"""Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare,"" he said."	0
40nyt14	1	a	And unlike the courtly Mr. Bentsen in 1988, Mr. Biden turned his temperature up, singeing the young man across the table with patronizing grins, but mostly withering retorts.	1
40hpo7	1	a	Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.	1
40fox39	0	a	On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it.	0
40hpo6	1	a	"""I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight,"" the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida."	1
40fox3	0	a	If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.	0
40nyt16	0	a	Mr. Ryan held his own, but did look abashed when Mr. Biden mocked him for opposing the Obama stimulus, yet asking for government funds for his own district.	0
40hpo54	0	a	“Stop talking about how you care about people.	0
40fox24	0	a	"Now they're trying to blame the Romney/Ryan ticket for making this an issue,"" he said."	0
40nyt7	1	a	He laughed at Mr. Ryan’s remarks so often and so heartily that at times he seemed like a guest at a comedy club roast, not a vice president debating the fate of the nation with his opponent.	1

40nyt25	0	a	She seemed determined to be less passive and sleepy than Jim Lehrer of PBS was as moderator of the Obama-Romney debate.	0

40hpo36	0	a	Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Biden’s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining.	0
40nyt9	1	a	Mr. Ryan tried to be respectful, listening to the vice president with a tilted head, choirboy smile and puppy-dog eyes, but he showed his irritation when Mr. Biden kept interrupting to attack his policy on Medicare.	1

3fox23	0	a	"And a number of us are just saying that's enough."""	0
3hpo20	1	a	If anything, the pitch being offered from the administration to the rest of the party was: take the package now or risk being blamed for an economic downturn.	1

3fox24	0	a	Obama rejected claims that he betrayed Democrats by cutting a deal with Republicans.	0
3hpo18	0	a	Asked, for instance, if the White House would be willing to revise the informal compromise to bring more Democratic lawmakers on board, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said any changes would be fine, so long as they didn't result in decreased support.	0
3hpo12	0	a	But the issue is, that the deal certainly is not enough to lift the economy to a different place.	0
3nyt2	0	a	The administration has been pushing back hard against criticism from fellow Democrats that the president has caved too much to Republicans.	0
3nyt4	0	a	“I just think it’s very important for Congress to examine the agreement, look at the facts, have a thorough debate, but get this done.	0

3nyt15	0	a	John Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a close ally of Mr. Obama, issued a statement calling the tax deal “a steep price” but saying the president was “right to choose helping working Americans over a December conflagration.” 	0
3nyt9	0	a	Officials said Mr. Biden will travel to the Hill around 4:30 p.m. in an attempt to sell the compromise Mr. Obama announced this week.	0
3hpo16	0	a	And on Wednesday, the White House began a robust process of selling the deal to Democrats -- skeptical, as they are, about an extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and a generous revision of the estate tax.	0

3hpo4	0	a	"""What I said it would significantly increase the risk,"" Summers replied."	0
3nyt14	0	a	The Democratic National Committee alerted reporters that Jennifer Granholm, the Democratic governor of Michigan, also supports the deal.	0
3hpo1	1	a	It wasn't quite the metaphorical flare of mushroom cloud imagery, but outgoing senior economic adviser Larry Summers offered a fairly dire assessment of the stakes in the tax cut debate.	1
3fox22	0	a	And they're trying to get us to jam it through again.	0
3fox27	0	a	"""So far, the response has not been very good,"" Pelosi said."	0
3fox19	0	a	DeFazio said House Democrats aren't going to keep rubber-stamping deals they don't like.	0
3nyt12	0	a	To counter condemnations from some Democrats in Congress, the White House circulated a series of e-mails quoting endorsements from private-sector economic forecasters, liberal as well as conservative analysts, and Democratic officeholders, including an obscure freshman House member, Representative Gary Peters of Michigan.	0
3nyt24	0	a	Mr. Biden’s visit with the House Democrats is likely to be as contentious as the one that he led with their Senate colleagues on Tuesday — if not more so.	0
3nyt25	0	a	Despite the closed-door lunchtime meeting, Senate aides told The Times afterward that about 30 Democratic senators remained “firmly opposed” to the president’s negotiated deal after hearing from the vice president.	0
3nyt5	0	a	The American people are watching, and they’re expecting action on our parts,” Mr. Obama said.	0
3nyt10	0	a	It will be the second time in two days that Mr. Biden has served as the liaison-in-chief for the White House.	0
3hpo22	0	a	"""Do they have a sense of how this ends and how long will that take, because as Larry said there are real consequences to that."	0
3fox14	0	a	Liberals are going as far as trying to prevent outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from bringing the tax cut compromise to the floor.	0
3hpo6	0	a	Summers himself, downplayed the significance of continuing the Bush tax cuts back in September -- though he was speaking, then, about the rates for the rich and the tax cut deal, at that point in time, did not include money for a 13-month extension of unemployment insurance or other tax incentives to help lower income workers.	0
3hpo25	0	a	And so there are real consequences to that decision.	0
3nyt3	0	a	In brief remarks after meeting with President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland, Mr. Obama on Wednesday emphatically disputed that Democrats generally feel betrayed by his deal with Congressional Republicans on the tax cuts, saying that “the more who look at it, the more will say this makes sense.”	0
3nyt18	0	a	The administration was quick to highlight comments from Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’sEconomy.com, projecting that the Obama tax deal would increase economic growth next year by 1.25 percentage points and create 1.6 million jobs.	0
3nyt22	1	a	Close to three dozen House Democrats have signed a letter from Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, calling the tax deal “fiscally irresponsible” and “grossly unfair.”	1
3fox10	0	a	Some Democrats are unhappy that Obama agreed to extend expiring tax cuts not just for the middle class but also for higher earners, and that he agreed to impose a lower estate tax on wealthy heirs.	0
3nyt0	0	a	Larry Summers, the outgoing chairman of the National Economic Council, just told a group of reporters that failure to pass a package like the tax deal announced by President Obama this week “would significantly increase the risk” of a double-dip recession.	0
3nyt23	0	a	The letter says Mr. Obama “should not back down. Nor should we.”	0
3nyt17	0	a	David Axelrod, the president’s chief political adviser, said on CNN’s “American Morning” that middle-class Americans were “going to get screwed” if their tax cuts were not extended at the end of the year.	0
3hpo11	0	a	And it ought to boost growth by some increment...	0
3hpo7	0	a	Asked whether the country would find itself dipping towards the economic doldrums if Congress waited a month or two to get a tax cut package passed, Rob Shapiro, a former commerce official in the Clinton White House and a proponent of the current tax cut deal, offered more sober-minded analysis.	0
3hpo5	1	a	The message was hardly subtle. But it certainly was debatable.	1
3fox25	0	a	"Speaking to reporters at a joint appearance with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, Obama said economists predict higher job growth in 2011 and 2012 if Congress passes the agreement and urged lawmakers to examine the details of the deal and ""get this done."""	0
3fox8	0	a	"Kyl said an official analysis and price tag, referred to as a ""score,"" from the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are not yet ready, but that the Senate could move to the bill anyway."	0
3fox7	0	a	Durbin would not detail what those changes are, deferring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.	0
3nyt11	0	a	Mr. Biden’s visit and the president’s comments come as the administration’s message machine started churning out statements of support.	0
3fox16	0	a	They're hoping to get 60 signatures on their letter and then force a vote in the caucus.	0
3hpo24	0	a	We know that on January 1 people's taxes will go up, we know that at the end of this month 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance.	0

3hpo14	0	a	"And I keep on saying this, the single most important thing they can do to avert that is to stabilize housing prices."""	0
3fox0	0	a	Outgoing White House economic adviser Larry Summers warned Wednesday that failure to pass a new tax cut compromise would significantly raise the risk of a double-dip recession.	0
3fox15	0	a	Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, and Jim McDermott and Jay Inslee of Washington state are crafting a letter to share with the House Democratic Caucus that would try to block the bill from seeing the light of day.	0
3hpo27	0	a	"And what we know for sure is that without any of it we are facing a really difficult situation."""	0
3hpo23	0	a	Just as the forecasts went up on the basis of this agreement they will go down if this agreement fails. That we know.	0
3nyt7	0	a	In a joint appearance at the White House with Mr. Komorowski, Mr. Obama said that “economists across the country have upwardly revised their forecasts for growth” after the tax deal was announced on Monday night.	0
3hpo0	0	a	"Senior White House officials significantly raised the stakes on congressional Democrats in their efforts to get a deal passed on the Bush tax cuts, warning on Wednesday that inaction would ""significantly increase the risk"" of a double dip recession."	0

3fox9	0	a	Vice President Biden traveled to the Capitol Wednesday for a private meeting with House Democrats who are resisting the deal, saying it gives away too much to the wealthy.	0
3nyt13	0	a	By noon, the White House press office had released supportive comments from Antonio Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, and Mr. Peters.	0
3fox6	0	a	"But, in a surprise move, Senate Democrats, meeting behind closed doors to discuss the tax deal, have asked the administration for ""changes"" to the bill, according to Sen Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber."	0
3nyt16	0	a	The Democratic National Committee also sent that statement around to reporters.	0

57hpo21	0	a	But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases ― and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical?	0
57hpo24	0	a	Judges time their retirements to coincide with a certain party being in office.	0
57nyt24	0	a	Asked for quick thoughts about each of the candidates he is known to be considering, Mr. Trump played along.	0
57fox15	1	a	Trump swiftly responded Tuesday, telling the Times it was “highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign.”	1
57nyt10	0	a	He continued: “That she should be saying that?	0
57nyt9	0	a	I couldn’t believe it when I saw it.”	0
57fox32	1	a	"The New York Times also chimed in: “Washington is more than partisan enough without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit."""	1

57fox7	0	a	For the country, it could be four years.	0
57hpo17	1	a	But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.	1

57fox31	0	a	The board noted the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges says that a “judge should not ... publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.”	0
57hpo18	0	a	Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience ― most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse.	0

57nyt25	0	a	Governor Christie? “Strong,” he said.	0
57nyt17	0	a	Mr. Trump said that he was not basing his vice-presidential selection on fund-raising prowess or potential, and indicated that he had had enough experience with many of those he has been considering for the job that their tryouts on the campaign trail would not necessarily be determinative.	0

86nyt0	1	a	WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose experience and stability were widely seen as a balance to an unpredictable president, resigned Thursday in protest of President Trump’s decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his rejection of international alliances.	1
86fox19	0	a	His resignation is effective December 31.	0
86nyt43	0	a	As defense secretary, Mr. Mattis oversaw the world’s most powerful military, supervising active-duty troops based in the United States and deployed worldwide, including in war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and on the Saudi border with Yemen.	0
86nyt35	1	a	The career Marine was respected among allies and adversaries and on Capitol Hill, and he was beloved in the Pentagon as a protector against a president with scant understanding of his own role as commander in chief.	1

86nyt11	0	a	The president said he would name a replacement soon.	0
86fox0	0	a	President Trump announced Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned and just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House.	0
86nyt13	0	a	Two Defense Department officials said Thursday that about 7,000 troops will be withdrawn in the coming months — cutting in half the number of American forces there — in an early step to ending the United States’ involvement in the 17-year war.	0
86hpo2	1	a	The Pentagon chief, nicknamed “Mad Dog Mattis” during his time as a Marine, echoed Trump’s call for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness.	1

86fox17	0	a	The Associated Press reported that McGurk said in a resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ISIS was on the run, but wasn’t yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasn’t yet done. 	0
86nyt48	0	a	But Mr. Mattis also quietly slow-walked a number of Mr. Trump’s proposals, including banning transgender troops, starting  a Space Force and putting on a costly military parade.	0
86nyt31	0	a	During Thursday’s meeting at the White House, officials said that Mr. Trump again asked Mr. Mattis to publicly endorse the Syria decision.	0
86nyt25	0	a	But Mr. Mattis’s core complaint was that Mr. Trump had lost sight of the importance of the competition for global power with Russia and China, who want “a world consistent with their authoritarian model.”	0
86nyt8	0	a	His resignation came as Congress appeared to be hurtling toward a government shutdown and as a deep market slump became even worse over fears of continuing government turmoil.	0

86nyt39	0	a	During his job interview with Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Mattis said he did not believe in torturing terrorism suspects to get information because he thought he could get more out of detainees by talking to them over a pack of cigarettes and a beer.	0
86hpo7	0	a	In the unusual letter, Mattis also wrote that he and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism: “Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.”	0

86hpo10	0	a	Additionally, forces were withdrawn despite the concern by many Republicans that “leaving would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad.”	0
86hpo15	0	a	A major split between Trump and Mattis concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin.	0
86hpo22	0	a	Trump went on to pull out of the deal in May, claiming that it had been poorly negotiated during the Obama administration.	0

86fox8	0	a	It was not immediately clear why Mattis' departure date was apparently moved up, but tension in the Defense Department and Washington generally has skyrocketed in the days since he suddenly announced his resignation.	0

86nyt9	0	a	With the ousting this month of John F.

86nyt22	0	a	Instead, it condemned Mr. Trump’s approach to the world as destructive to American influence and power.	0
86nyt10	0	a	Mr. Trump said that Mr. Mattis, 68, will leave at the end of February, and that Mr. Mattis “was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.”	0
86nyt2	0	a	But on Thursday, in an extraordinary rebuke of the president, he decided that Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 American troops from Syria was a step too far.	0
86hpo11	0	a	News of Mattis’ departure comes in the wake of reports that the White House had been discussing who might replace him, a topic that was first reported by The Washington Post in early September.	0
86hpo14	1	a	That assurance came ahead of the release of a book by acclaimed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward, which reported that Mattis once told staffers that Trump has the understanding of a “fifth- or sixth-grader.” Mattis has denied having said that.	1
86nyt3	0	a	Officials said Mr. Mattis went to the White House with his resignation letter already written, but nonetheless made a last attempt at persuading the president to reverse his decision about Syria, which Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday over the objections of his senior advisers.	0
86nyt28	0	a	Among his other concerns, Mr. Mattis viewed the withdrawal as abandoning Kurdish fighters and other American allies, and as ceding critical territory to Russia and Iran.	0
86hpo28	0	a	Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year, and Tom Price stepped aside as secretary of health and human services last fall amid ethical questions about his travel practices.	0
86nyt26	1	a	Mr. Mattis was the primary author of a new American defense strategy whose central goal was to take on “revisionist” powers — an approach that some of Mr. Trump’s former advisers say the president never fully comprehended.	1
86nyt37	0	a	Though a colorful, hard-charging advocate of aggressive offensive action, Mr. Mattis viewed a tough American posture overseas as a way to deter war, not to start them, with potential foes like Iran.	0
86nyt1	0	a	Mr. Mattis had repeatedly told friends and aides over recent months that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States’ 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president.	0

86nyt5	0	a	Returning to the Pentagon, he asked aides to print out 50 copies of his resignation letter and distribute them around the building.	0
86nyt33	0	a	The president’s tweets announcing the departure of his defense secretary shocked officials at the Pentagon, who as recently as Thursday afternoon were insisting that Mr. Mattis had no intention of resigning.	0
86hpo1	0	a	Mattis, who served more than four decades in the military and headed the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, won Senate confirmation as defense secretary on Jan. 20, 2017, shortly after Trump’s inauguration.	0
86hpo6	0	a	“Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.”	0
86fox6	1	a	Also on Thursday, Trump had said Mattis -- the first Cabinet official in 40 years to resign over a stated policy difference with the president -- was leaving in February.	1
86nyt19	1	a	It was also the first resignation over a major national security issue by a leading cabinet member since 1980, when Cyrus Vance quit as secretary of state.	1
86nyt23	0	a	He said the core of American national interests lay in “providing effective leadership to our alliances,” and specifically described the importance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a defense alliance Mr. Trump has often derided.	0

95nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — As State Department lawyers sifted last summer through a new batch of documents related to the Benghazi attacks, they repeatedly saw something that caught their attention: emails sent to and from a personal account for Hillary Rodham Clinton.	0
95nyt8	0	a	Beginning in August, senior State Department officials held negotiations with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers and advisers to gain access to her personal email records.	0

59nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama’s demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.	0
59hpo17	0	a	A top Senate Democratic aide told the Huffington Post on Thursday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told his caucus that finalizing a deal by Christmas was now basically impossible.	0

59nyt6	0	a	The latest meeting gave rise to renewed optimism that a deal could be reached before the end of the month.	0

59nyt14	0	a	Mr. Corker, a member of the Banking Committee who had presented a deficit-reduction plan of his own, said that if Republicans gave in to the president’s chief demand, then “all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements, and maybe it puts us in a place where we actually can do something that really saves the nation.”	0
59nyt12	0	a	Between public statements and news conferences, the staffs of the president and the speaker have been in close contact.	0
59nyt13	0	a	Just hours before the White House meeting, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said on “Fox News Sunday” that a small but growing group of Republicans had begun considering acquiescing on tax rates so that the negotiations could shift to entitlement programs.	0
59nyt20	0	a	“It would result in the stock market really taking a hit,” Ms. Lagarde said on the CNN program “State of the Union.”	0
59fox27	0	a	Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the No. 3 Republican in the House, suggested Sunday that the president's itinerary has left Republicans to negotiate with themselves.	0
59hpo22	1	a	He wants to makes sure, first and foremost, that the middle class does not have their taxes go up on January 1st.”	1
59hpo15	0	a	The White House, in contrast, has accused House Republican leadership of being deliberately vague on cuts, while insisting that no deal will end up getting the president's signature without a raising of tax rates.	0
59fox30	0	a	"Democratic Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin countered that Obama ""is a phone call away and you know it."""	0
59nyt15	0	a	Republicans have been insisting that the Obama administration agree to substantial savings in entitlement programs as the two sides negotiate how to narrow the country’s huge deficits.	0

59fox23	0	a	"""We've got to break that habit before it starts,"" the president said."	0
59fox24	0	a	The president argues that fights over the debt ceiling merely shake global confidence in the country's ability to pay its bills, and as part of talks over the looming fiscal crisis has called for a de facto permanent increase in the debt limit.	0
59fox8	0	a	Boehner last week put a counter-proposal on the table that included $800 billion in revenue increases over the next decade.	0
59fox0	0	a	President Obama was heading to Detroit Monday afternoon to continue campaigning for tax hikes on top earners -- a day after a face-to-face meeting with House Speaker John Boehner that offered slight hope the two could be making progress toward a deal.	0
59nyt11	0	a	But the ups and downs of the search for a deal to avert a fiscal crisis have been in large measure for public consumption.	0
59nyt24	0	a	Ms. Lagarde offered a tentative prediction that what she called American “pragmatism” would prevail and avert the worst outcome.	0
59fox13	0	a	However, a growing number of Republicans are suggesting the party should give Obama what he wants on tax rates -- and focus instead on winning entitlement cuts once that is cleared away.	0
59fox17	0	a	Corker suggested that Republicans instead focus on extracting entitlement cuts as part of the debt-ceiling negotiations.	0
59nyt16	0	a	But Mr. Corker is part of a group of Republicans who say the party will ultimately have to yield to the Obama demand of higher tax rates for top earners, potentially back to the levels that prevailed under President Bill Clinton.	0
59fox20	0	a	Corker said that if the president wants to raise the debt limit by $2 trillion, Republicans should press for $2 trillion in spending cuts.	0
59fox9	0	a	While Boehner cast that as a significant concession, Obama said it didn't go far enough because it didn't include an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent.	0
59hpo19	0	a	White House Press Secretary Jay Carney wouldn’t say whether Obama is also bracing for dragged out negotiations	0
59hpo12	0	a	Thursday night’s meeting marks the second time in a week the president and House speaker have met in person, and comes after at least two phone calls in recent days.	0
59hpo5	0	a	"There will be no further readout of the meeting, but lines of communication remain open."""	0
59fox19	0	a	"""The leverage is going to shift to our side, where hopefully we'll do the same thing we did last time."""	0
59fox7	0	a	Lawmakers and the White House have three weeks to reach a deal, before a potentially crippling set of tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect.	0
59hpo14	0	a	Boehner has refused to budge from his refusal to consider raising tax rates on top earners while arguing that heavy spending cuts are needed.	0
59fox12	0	a	Some say Congress should not raise any taxes, and were disappointed he went so far as to put any revenue on the table.	0
59hpo10	0	a	Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary, and Rob Nabors, director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, joined Obama, a White House aide confirmed.	0
59fox10	0	a	Boehner, though, is facing some pressure from Republicans to give a little bit more.	0
59hpo3	0	a	"""The President and Speaker had a frank meeting in the Oval Office tonight,"" said the statements."	0
59hpo21	0	a	“What the president is interested in is working with Congress to achieve a deal that avoids the fiscal cliff and, beyond that, addresses our long-term fiscal challenges in a balanced way.	0
59nyt17	0	a	That group of Republicans, Mr. Corker said on Fox, was beginning to realize “that we don’t have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue before year end” — but that a tax-rate concession could be converted, jujitsu style, into a tactical advantage.	0
59fox4	0	a	But instead of emerging from the talks complaining about each other, as was the case following phone calls last week, each side released an identical statement.	0
59fox2	1	a	"It came after Boehner publicly chided Obama on Friday for the lack of progress to date, accusing the president of having ""wasted another week."""	1
59fox21	0	a	That prospect is sure to infuriate the White House.	0
59hpo4	0	a	"""It lasted approximately 50 minutes."	0
59fox26	0	a	His campaign-style visit to Detroit, though, threatens to muddy the waters on talks.	0
59hpo13	0	a	The continued dialogue provides some rays of hope to a negotiating process that, in recent days, has shown very little progress.	0

92nyt28	0	a	He left the Patrick administration last year to return to the private sector, but said this brief detour to Washington was a sacrifice worth making because he wanted to give something back to the state that had given him so much.	0

38fox23	0	a	Pelosi also described her upcoming role of contrasting Democrats to Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration as a “historic challenge” that goes “beyond politics.”	0
38fox14	0	a	… Today, we made our caucus more representative of our members.”	0
38nyt34	1	a	But each new idea has underscored the fact that Ms. Pelosi refuses to relinquish much power and has cultivated a large, loyal following that does not expect her to.	1
38fox32	0	a	Rep. Loretta Sanchez won the competition for vice Democratic Caucus chairman, defeating fellow California congresswoman Barbara Lee.	0
38fox10	0	a	I’m disappointed, but I think the party’s better off because of this.”	0
38hpo13	0	a	They say it’s not her fault when Democrats lose at the polls, either.	0
38hpo27	0	a	During the closed-door caucus meeting, several Democrats went to bat for Pelosi. Reps. Adam Schiff (Calif.), Gwen Moore (Wis.), Bill Pascrell (N.J.), Katherine Clark (Mass.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Debbie Dingell (Mich.) each gave nominating speeches for her.	0
38nyt10	0	a	“We know how to win elections,” Ms. Pelosi said.	0
38hpo8	0	a	The same people have been running the caucus for years ― Pelosi, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.) and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (S.C.) ― and they’re all in their 70s now.	0
38fox28	1	a	In the days before Wednesday’s vote, Pelosi, a prolific fundraiser, promised some changes to assuage concerns in her caucus, including adding a member of the freshmen class to her leadership team.	1
38nyt3	1	a	But while Ms. Pelosi won, 134 to 63, Mr. Ryan’s significant share of the total served as a measure of internal discontent and in some ways a repudiation of Ms. Pelosi’s leadership.	1
38fox0	0	a	California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday was appointed to an eighth term as House minority leader, surviving a challenge from a Midwestern Democrat backed by caucus members frustrated over repeated election loses and an aging leadership team.	0
38fox15	0	a	Another criticism among rank-and-file House Democrats was that the top posts are largely filled by East and West coast members, not those from the heartland.	0
38hpo22	0	a	“We’ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.”	0
38hpo16	0	a	If Ryan had replaced her, it would have become all white men.	0

38fox21	0	a	“We’ve done it in the past and we’ll do it again.	0
38nyt8	0	a	Ms. Pelosi, whose victory was mockingly cheered by Republicans as good news for them, dismissed the idea that House Democrats could no longer win with her at the helm.	0
38hpo3	0	a	It’s a decisive win, and it (barely) clears the two-thirds majority support that Pelosi predicted she had.	0
38hpo17	0	a	The California Democrat spoke briefly to reporters after the vote, saying she feels “exhilarated” at being re-elected.	0
38nyt12	0	a	Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, who backed Mr. Ryan, said after the vote that unless Democrats changed course and adopted “a working man and woman’s agenda,” they should expect defeat.	0
38fox30	0	a	Republicans are on track to hold at least 240 seats in the House next year.	0
38nyt21	0	a	But in an interview Tuesday, Mr. Ryan suggested few ideas for how to appeal to voters beyond essentially crowdsourcing the task to more House Democrats, and he offered no indication that working with the Republican majority on any particular policy compromises would be a priority.	0
38hpo20	0	a	“How we go forward in our caucus to put forth our values, which are what unite us a caucus, to differentiate between us and the administration that will come into Washington in January, to take that message clearly to the public, is something that is a historic challenge.”	0
38hpo32	0	a	“Leader Pelosi always listened and she always understood.”	0
38fox26	0	a	"""I believe we must do more than simply paper over the cracks,"" said Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, one of a handful of House Democrats to endorse Ryan."	0
38hpo19	1	a	It’s about the character of America,” Pelosi said.	1
38fox25	0	a	Many are discouraged after losing the White House and making smaller than expected gains in both chambers of Congress.	0
38fox31	0	a	Democrats, who had high hopes of significant gains in the election, picked up just six seats on Election Day earlier this month and remain in the minority with 194 seats.	0
38nyt2	0	a	The leadership elections, conducted by secret ballot behind closed doors, stamped out calls for new leaders.	0
38nyt32	1	a	Trying to quell calls to replace her, Ms. Pelosi announced her nominations last week for a handful of other positions, and proposed that three members from Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York share the leadership duties of the party’s messaging committee, offering more regional diversity.	1
38fox36	0	a	“I’m really honored and emotional to be standing here among a group of such great leaders,” Sanchez said in second, late-afternoon press conference led by Pelosi.	0
38fox24	0	a	Leadership elections were originally scheduled to be held before Thanksgiving but were delayed to give Democrats more time to discuss and process the election results and consider a path forward.	0
38hpo7	0	a	Pelosi has led House Democrats since 2003, and that’s what Ryan had argued is the problem.	0
38fox13	0	a	“We now have a leadership team that listens to us.	0
38nyt30	0	a	Though he collected only a dozen or so public endorsements, Mr. Ryan mounted an unlikely challenge to Ms. Pelosi, long considered a legislative and fund-raising powerhouse.	0
38hpo14	0	a	“You can’t really blame Nancy Pelosi for gerrymandering and for the national election,” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) told reporters.	0
38nyt35	0	a	It is from that sizable collection of House Democrats that she draws her picks for smaller leadership posts, making her a powerful ally and, for those like Mr. Ryan who have challenged her, a formidable opponent.	0
38nyt17	0	a	Representative Joseph Crowley of New York was also elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and in a narrow victory, 98 to 96, Representative Linda T. Sánchez of California defeated another California Democrat, Representative Barbara Lee, to become vice chairwoman.	0
38fox33	0	a	Lee is a former Congressional Black Caucus chairman.	0
38hpo28	0	a	“Everything we care about [is] at risk,” Schiff told the room.	0
38hpo10	1	a	House Democrats have also lost nearly 60 seats over the past six years.	1
38hpo23	0	a	Asked about the 63 Democrats who voted for Ryan, Pelosi said, “I got two-thirds of the vote.”	0
38fox2	0	a	She won by a 134-to-63 vote.	0
38nyt7	0	a	In 2010, after a wave of Tea Party Republicans swept Democrats out of power, she lost just 43 votes.	0
38hpo12	1	a	Pelosi’s supporters said her experience is what the party needs now more than ever, going up against President-elect Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress: She’s battle-tested, she’s a prolific fundraiser and she knows better than anyone how to count votes and keep her party together.	1
38nyt11	0	a	“We’ve done it in the past. We will do it again by making that differentiation.”	0

38nyt6	1	a	For years, support for Ms. Pelosi has run so deep that few would even consider challenging her.	1
38fox11	0	a	Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, among the handful of House Democrats who backed Ryan's bid, said the effort to unseat Pelosi was not a failure.	0
38hpo15	0	a	She’s also the only woman in top House and Senate leadership.	0
38hpo1	1	a	But more than 60 Democrats voted against her ― a stunning level of dissent at a time when the party is trying to pick up the pieces after a disastrous presidential election.	1
38hpo4	1	a	But it reveals that dozens in her caucus voted against her in secret ballots. That’s a lot.	1
38fox37	0	a	Other top leadership posts were uncontested.	0
38fox1	0	a	Pelosi was challenged by Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan in a secret-ballot vote among House Democrats.	0

38hpo18	0	a	“Today has a special excitement for me because I think we’re at a time where it is well beyond politics.	0
38hpo24	0	a	Separately, Ryan told reporters the race didn’t turn out as he wanted but he thinks he did “a pretty good job” of bringing economic issues to the forefront.	0
38nyt26	0	a	“You should go there and engage people and tell them what you believe in.”	0

38fox8	0	a	“We knew it was going to be an uphill battle.	0
38nyt14	0	a	Democrats also re-elected Representative Steny H. Hoyer, 77, of Maryland as whip, the No. 2 position, as well as Representative James E. Clyburn, 76, of South Carolina in the No. 3 spot as the assistant Democratic leader.	0
38nyt1	0	a	Ms. Pelosi’s victory over Representative Tim Ryan, a 43-year-old congressman from a blue-collar district anchored in Youngstown, Ohio, ensures that the party will be led in the next Congress by the established “coastal” Democrats who have increasingly defined it — Ms. Pelosi, 76, who represents San Francisco, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, 66, who has held various leadership posts since 2005.	0
38nyt5	0	a	“And a lot of really wanting to have a plan.”	0
38hpo29	0	a	“We need the very best to lead us.	0
38hpo9	0	a	Some say they’re not the right messengers to energize the base and convey an economic message that appeals to people beyond the two coasts.	0

38hpo34	1	a	He said the California progressive has lost the connection with working-class people in the Midwest ― the same people who make up his district, and the same people who turned out in droves to vote for Trump and help defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton weeks ago.	1
38fox5	0	a	Ryan, after a disappointing 2016 election cycle for Democrats, argued that newer lawmakers in the party need a bigger, fresher voice to represent them, instead of the same slate of leaders and committee chairmen.	0
38fox17	0	a	Democrats lost the House majority in the 2010 Tea Party-inspired wave election.	0
38fox34	0	a	Sanchez formerly led the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.	0

38nyt36	0	a	“She has a lot of friends,” Mr. Ryan said.	0

1fox9	0	a	Trump on Tuesday specifically cited Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus' concerns about his involvement.	0
1nyt8	0	a	Mr. Trump was facing a potentially awkward task: moderating a debate that only two candidates said they would attend.	0
1nyt7	0	a	“I must leave all of my options open because, above all else, we must make America great again!” he said.	0
1hpo5	0	a	The announcement came just eleven days after Trump initially said he was partnering with the conservative magazine to host a forum with the remaining Republican presidential candidates.	0
1hpo3	0	a	"Trump said that he was ending the debate because he did not want to ""give up my right to run as an independent candidate,"" which he claimed the Republican Party was asking him to do if he wanted to moderate the debate."	0

1hpo1	0	a	"""I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate,"" Trump said in a statement."	0
1fox2	0	a	He cast his decision as a way to keep his options open.	0
1fox0	1	a	Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is bowing out as the moderator for a Republican presidential debate later this month, after most candidates in the field opted not to attend.	1
1hpo7	1	a	Trump also attracted the usual share of public ridicule for his decision to moderate, as well as his pledge to endorse whichever candidate he liked best at the debate.	1
1fox8	0	a	Some expressed concern that Trump, who previously flirted with a possible Republican presidential bid before shelving the idea, would not definitively rule out running as a third-party candidate.	0
1fox15	0	a	"""Therefore, so that there is no conflict of interest within the Republican Party, I have decided not to be the moderator of the Newsmax debate."	0

1nyt11	0	a	Mr. Trump issued the following exclamation-point laden statement through his lawyer, Michael Cohen.	0

10nyt7	0	a	And so, sentence by sentence, in accents that reflect the myriad districts that did not even exist when the document came into being, by women and African Americans whose full rights were not recognized at that time, the constitutional language fluttered through the chamber.	0
10hpo13	1	a	It is also quite obvious, from 223 years of legal and political debate on the topic, that the text of the Constitution itself, including those portions that deal with legislative power, is susceptible to many different (and often evolving) views and interpretations, a practical reality that would likely render most “Constitutional Authority Statements” controversial and contentious.”	1

54hpo0	1	a	WASHINGTON—Joining a chorus of Catholic bishops , theologians, priests, and social justice leaders, nearly 90 Georgetown University faculty and administrators have called Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) to task for his misuse of Catholic social teaching in defending his budget, which hurts the poor.	1
54hpo7	0	a	The letter quotes the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which wrote several letters to Congress saying “a just framework for future budgets cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to poor persons.”	0
54fox11	0	a	Georgetown's Public Policy Institute, which is hosting the upcoming Ryan lecture, said Wednesday the event is still scheduled for Thursday morning.	0
54fox1	0	a	A group of nearly 90 professors and administrators connected to the Jesuit-founded school in Washington, D.C., has sent Ryan, R-Wis., a letter saying he’s misused Catholic doctrine to support his deficit-reducing, GOP House budget.	0

54fox6	0	a	"""To me, the principle of subsidiarity, which is really federalism, meaning government closest to the people governs best,"" he said."	0
54fox7	1	a	The Georgetown University letter argues, though, that Ryan misappropriated the Catholic teaching as a “rationale for gutting government programs.”	1
54nyt0	0	a	Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been excoriated by some Roman Catholic leaders ever since he claimed this month that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, was inspired by the moral teachings of his Catholic faith.	0
54fox5	0	a	"In that interview, he invoked the Catholic teaching of ""subsidiarity,"" saying it means ""not having big government crowd out civic society, but ... having enough space in our communities so that we can interact with each other"" and take care of people."	0
54nyt14	0	a	The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued several letters to members of Congress calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor.	0
54hpo12	0	a	The Georgetown scholars pointed to the devastating impact of cuts in food programs that keep the poor from starvation.	0
54nyt1	0	a	The latest criticism comes in a letter released Tuesday and signed by nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown, the Jesuit university in Washington, in advance of Mr. Ryan’s visit there on Thursday.	0
54nyt11	0	a	In an interview this month on the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Ryan claimed that his budget was consistent with Catholic moral teaching because it pushes the poor to become independent of government assistance.	0

54hpo5	0	a	As scholars, we want to join the Catholic bishops in pointing out that his budget has a devastating impact on programs for the poor.”	0
54nyt10	0	a	The budget authored by Mr. Ryan, a rising star among conservatives, has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to distance the church from the Republican Party.	0
54hpo14	0	a	The scholars corrected Mr. Ryan on his use of the Catholic concept of “subsidiarity” as “a rationale gutting government programs.”	0
54fox12	0	a	"""Chairman Ryan remains grateful for Georgetown's invitation to advance a thoughtful dialogue this week on his efforts to avert a looming debt crisis that would hurt the poor the first and the worst,” a Ryan spokesman said."	0
54nyt3	1	a	The letter says, “We would be remiss in our duty to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.”	1
54hpo4	1	a	“This is nonsense.	1
54hpo9	0	a	Last week, Rep. Ryan dismissed the bishops’ critique, erroneously claiming the letters didn’t represent “all the bishops,” a point the USCCB media office denied.	0

54hpo3	0	a	“Our problem with Representative Ryan is that he claims his budget is based on Catholic social teaching,” said Jesuit Father Thomas J. Reese , one of the organizers of the letter.	0
54hpo2	0	a	In their letter to Ryan, the scholars make clear they are not objecting to his speaking on campus, but rather his recent comments defending his budget on Christian grounds.	0
54hpo8	0	a	The bishops noted that “the House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria.”	0
54fox2	0	a	“We appreciate your willingness to talk about how Catholic social teaching can help inform effective policy in dealing with the urgent challenges facing our country,” the letter states.	0
54nyt7	1	a	Their condemnation has grown so heated that this month, Bishop Daniel Jenky, of Peoria, Ill., said in a homily that President Obama was so intolerant of religion that he was “following a similar path” as Hitler and Stalin.	1

54fox4	0	a	Ryan, since introducing the budget last month, has talked about the doctrine in several interviews including one a couple weeks ago on the Christian Broadcasting Network.	0

54fox14	1	a	"Ryan, who was raised on Social Security benefits after his father died, also on Fox News defended his budget against the conference, saying for instance that the concept of denying tax credits to illegal immigrants is merely ""following through on policy"" that has had bipartisan support."	1
54nyt13	0	a	The letter released Tuesday by the faculty at Georgetown took Mr. Ryan to task for that argument, saying that Catholic teaching calls for government to step in and help when communities “face problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.”	0
54fox10	0	a	Ryan, a Catholic and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said last week the letters do not express the views of all U.S. bishops, a point on which the conference disagrees.	0
54hpo16	0	a	But it also demands that higher levels of government provide help—‘subsidium’—when communities and local governments face problems beyond their means to address such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.”	0
54hpo18	0	a	Signing the letter were over a dozen Georgetown Jesuit priests, numerous members of the Theology and other departments including History, Government, Philosophy, School of Foreign Service and School of Nursing & Health Studies.	0
54nyt15	1	a	Mr. Ryan claimed in a recent interview that those letters did not speak for all bishops, but the conference responded that those letters do indeed represent the bishops’ collective opinion.	1

54nyt12	0	a	“The preferential option for the poor, which is one of the primary tenants of Catholic social teaching, means don’t keep people poor, don’t make people dependent on government so that they stay stuck at their station in life, help people get out of poverty out onto life of independence,” he said.	0

19nyt20	0	a	Mr. Sestak first mentioned publicly in February that he had been offered a job but provided no details, and the White House for three months had refused to discuss it, generating intense criticism from Republicans who accused it of trying to bribe a congressman and deep consternation among Democrats who called on the administration to answer questions.	0
19fox26	0	a	"Critics say the Sestak job offer may have violated the part of the U.S. code that says: ""Whoever, directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation...appointment...provided for or made possible in whole or in part by any Act of Congress...to any person as consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity...or in connection with any primary election ...shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both."""	0
19fox7	0	a	As president, Clinton promoted Sestak to vice admiral and made him his director of defense policy.	0
19hpo2	0	a	The White House initiated the conversation, which occurred over phone.	0
19nyt5	0	a	“The Democratic Party leadership had a legitimate interest in averting a divisive primary fight and a similarly legitimate concern about the congressman vacating his seat in the House.”	0
19fox16	1	a	On that same day, Obama had lunch with Clinton.	1
19nyt15	0	a	The White House did not disclose what those options were, but people briefed on the matter said one option was an appointment to the president’s Intelligence Advisory Board, a panel of prominent Americans outside government who provide independent oversight of the nation’s spy apparatus and advise the president.	0
19hpo4	0	a	The source said it would not be surprising if more than one conversation took place, though there were no other intermediaries involved.	0

19hpo15	0	a	Since then, much intrigue has surrounded what conversations actually took place.	0
19hpo11	0	a	Administration officials had spent time and capital recruiting Senator Arlen Specter to switch parties and run for re-election as a Democrat.	0
19nyt30	1	a	Democrats and some Republicans have said it is hardly unusual for presidents to offer political appointments to clear the way for allies.	1
19nyt10	1	a	“It is abundantly clear that this kind of conduct is contrary to President Obama’s pledge to change ’business as usual’ and that his administration has engaged in the kind of political shenanigans he once campaigned to end.”	1
19nyt31	0	a	But Republicans have suggested such actions may constitute a crime.	0
19nyt3	0	a	The White House disputed Republican claims that the conversations might be illegal or improper.	0
19nyt14	0	a	The White House did not offer Mr. Sestak a full-time paid position because Mr. Emanuel wanted him to stay in the House rather than risk losing his seat, so he considered “uncompensated advisory board options.”	0
19hpo3	0	a	It would have allowed Sestak to remain in the House of Representatives while advising the president.	0
19fox8	0	a	Sestak was also a loyal and tireless supporter of Hillary Clinton's run for the presidency in 2008.	0
19hpo24	0	a	The source insisted that no laws were broken in the process of offering the position, that the matter hardly rose to the level of political scandal -- suggesting that Republicans on the Hill were hoping to reap political benefits from the saga.	0
19fox3	0	a	One of the jobs Clinton specifically discussed with Sestak was the president's intelligence advisory board.	0

19fox18	1	a	"This is a felony,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who has been leading the charge for more details on the allegation."	1

19hpo21	0	a	The investigation was internal at first with the White House reaching conclusions at least two-and-a-half months ago.	0
19nyt17	0	a	In a statement Friday, Mr. Sestak said Mr. Clinton had conveyed Mr. Emanuel’s suggestion that he join a “presidential board” while remaining in the House, but he declined.	0
19fox2	0	a	Batting down allegations that the White House dangled the secretary of Navy position in front of Sestak, the report said that Sestak was offered executive branch positions on advisory boards that were uncompensated.	0
19nyt2	0	a	Mr. Sestak said no and went on to win last week’s primary against Senator Arlen Specter.	0
19nyt23	0	a	In tapping Mr. Clinton as the go-between, Mr. Emanuel picked the party’s most prominent figure other than Mr. Obama and someone Mr. Sestak had worked for on the National Security Council in the 1990s.	0
19fox12	0	a	"The White House report disputed any suggestion that there was ""impropriety"" in Clinton's discussion with Sestak over possible alternatives to his Senate candidacy."	0
19fox4	0	a	But a White House official said the plan always was for Sestak to remain in the House, and he couldn't have served in the House and on the president's intelligence advisory board.	0
19nyt26	0	a	As chief of staff and previously as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Emanuel has not been shy about trying to steer party nominations to those he considers the stronger candidates.	0
19hpo7	0	a	The account offered by the source was the most detailed to date from primary sources as to the conversations they had with Sestak regarding his entrance into the Pennsylvania race.	0
19hpo18	0	a	The White House, when pressed on the matter, had been vague.	0
19hpo13	0	a	When Sestak began making overtures that he would run, the White House looked for ways to follow through on its promise.	0
19hpo12	0	a	Part of that arrangement entailed clearing the field for his nomination.	0

90nyt2	0	a	Her comments marked the strongest public rebuke to date by the Obama administration since Mr. Netanyahu accepted an invitation from Speaker John A. Boehner to make his case to Congress against a nuclear deal with Iran, which is a priority of Mr. Obama’s.	0

80fox0	0	a	A pending class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart that would be the largest of its kind in U.S. history may soon be dismissed, considering the tenor of oral arguments before the Supreme Court Tuesday.	0
80hpo18	0	a	Ginsburg, who made her name as a lawyer by bringing discrimination claims, said it was possible that Wal-Mart could refute the claims at a trial.	0
80hpo11	0	a	He said Wal-Mart's strong corporate culture stereotypes women as less aggressive than men and that translates into individual pay and promotion decisions at the more than 4,300 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores across the country.	0
80nyt6	0	a	It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court’s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.	0
80fox19	0	a	But they are not big enough where they can't be challenged in a court of law.	0
80nyt9	0	a	The plaintiffs’ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes.	0
80fox30	0	a	"But those two remedies require different standards for class certification and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it was ""a very serious problem"" in the case to try and sue for punitive damages after only obtaining certification under the lower threshold required for the injunction."	0
80fox25	0	a	Wal-Mart lawyer Theodore Boutrous argued that every member of the class couldn't possibly meet a standard of commonality to justify the lawsuit.	0
80hpo20	0	a	But several of their more conservative colleagues appeared to agree with Theodore Boutrous Jr., representing Wal-Mart, that even subjecting the company to a trial would be unfair.	0
80hpo12	0	a	"""The decisions are informed by the values the company provides,"" Sellers said."	0
80hpo4	0	a	In Tuesday's arguments, several justices suggested they were troubled by the case and lower court decisions against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart.	0
80nyt25	0	a	“If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,” he said, “you don’t have discretion.”	0
80fox6	0	a	It also claims that despite a company policy expressly prohibiting discrimination, local store managers are given too much flexibility in determining salary hikes and job promotions that invariably favor men over women.	0
80hpo16	0	a	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that at this stage of the lawsuit, the issue is not proving discrimination but showing enough evidence to go forward.	0
80fox28	0	a	Another technical concern that appears to work against the women covers the different types of remedies they are seeking.	0
80fox17	0	a	On Tuesday, Dukes walked out of the courthouse full of confidence and poise saying she feels no anger toward her bosses or anyone else.	0
80nyt31	0	a	“What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?” Justice Ginsburg asked.	0
80hpo14	0	a	"""Well, which is it?"" Scalia asked."	0
80nyt32	0	a	Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions.	0
80nyt41	0	a	It doesn’t comport with due process.	0
80nyt38	0	a	“The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,” Mr. Boutrous said.	0
80nyt2	0	a	Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.	0
80nyt8	0	a	For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.	0
80fox7	0	a	This dual argument that confounded Justice Kennedy also drew the ire of Justice Antonin Scalia who said he was whipsawed by the claims.	0
80fox3	0	a	"""Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on,"" Kennedy told lawyer Joseph Sellers who represents the women."	0

80hpo17	0	a	"""We're talking about getting a foot in the door,"" Ginsburg said, a standard she called not hard to meet."	0
80hpo5	0	a	Estimates of how many women could be included in the lawsuit run from 500,000 to 1.6 million.	0
80hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appears ready to block a massive sex discrimination lawsuit against Wal-Mart on behalf of up to 1.6 million women, and that could make it harder for other workers nationwide to bring class-action claims against large employers.	0
80nyt7	0	a	The issue before the justices at Tuesday’s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there.	0
80fox23	1	a	The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and major corporations including Bank of America, General Electric and Microsoft submitted briefs in the case supporting Wal-Mart.	1
80hpo13	0	a	"Justice Antonin Scalia said he felt ""whipsawed"" by Sellers' description."	0
80nyt33	0	a	Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.	0
80hpo1	0	a	The 10-year-old lawsuit, argued in lively exchanges at the court Tuesday, claims that Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest employer, favors men over women in pay and promotions.	0
80nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart.	0
80nyt51	0	a	“Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII” of the Civil Rights Act?	0
80nyt17	0	a	“Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?” Justice Breyer asked.	0
80hpo10	0	a	Sellers said that lower courts had been persuaded by statistical and other evidence put forth so far in the lawsuit.	0
80fox8	0	a	"""If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion,"" he said."	0
80fox12	0	a	The case started a decade ago when Wal-Mart worker Betty Dukes said the management at her Pittsburg, Calif., store was bypassing her for promotions.	0
80nyt19	0	a	And Justice Elena Kagan said that “excessive subjectivity” may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.	0
80nyt16	0	a	But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores.	0
80hpo25	0	a	Two of the named plaintiffs, Christine Kwapnoski and Betty Dukes, attended the argument.	0
80nyt47	0	a	After all, he said, “you’re going to have some bad apples” given Wal-Mart’s thousands of stores.	0
80nyt44	0	a	Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. “The comparison that’s relevant,” he said, “is between men and women and Wal-Mart.”	0
80hpo6	0	a	Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a key vote on the high court, said the women's argument points in apparently conflicting directions.	0
80hpo2	0	a	Billions of dollars are at stake if it is allowed to go forward.	0
80nyt52	0	a	“That could very well be the case,” Mr. Sellers said.	0
80nyt26	0	a	Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.	0
80hpo32	0	a	David Sanford, who represents plaintiffs in other class-action cases, said after the arguments that the court seemed inclined to rule against the Wal-Mart women.	0
80hpo33	1	a	"Sanford said such a decision could ""have implications for class actions more generally, making it more difficult for women and minority groups to enjoy equality and fair treatment in the workplace."""	1
80fox29	0	a	In addition to the punitive damages they want an injunction that would force Wal-Mart to adopt more stringent anti-discrimination policies.	0
80nyt3	0	a	The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.	0
80fox13	1	a	"""I could see the men going forth and the women in the store stayed in the basic positions they were always in,"" Dukes once told an interviewer."	1
80hpo15	0	a	"Either individual managers are on their own, ""or else a strong corporate culture tells them what to do."""	0
80hpo34	0	a	The Obama administration is not taking part in the case, although it was lobbied by both sides.	0
80nyt28	1	a	“One of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.”	1
80nyt10	0	a	The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.	0
80fox4	0	a	"""Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these (local) supervisors have too much discretion."""	0
80fox31	0	a	It's possible that instead of an outright victory for Wal-Mart, the justices could issue a split decision of sorts and allow only the injunction part of the lawsuit to move forward.	0
80nyt39	0	a	“Then he says we’re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision.	0

80hpo24	0	a	"He pointed to a group of at least 544 women who serve as store managers who ""are alleged to be both discriminators and victims."""	0
80fox11	0	a	Sellers said that wasn't a fair comparison because Wal-Mart has an obligation under federal law to make sure its managers do not discriminate.	0
80fox21	0	a	"From the least of us to the greatest of us."""	0
80hpo26	0	a	Kwapnoski is an assistant manager at a Sam's Club in Concord, Calif. Dukes is a greeter at the Wal-Mart in Pittsburg, Calif.	0
80nyt1	1	a	Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars.	1
80hpo8	0	a	"""Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion."	0
80hpo22	0	a	Boutrous said the class-action nature of the case deprives the company of its legal rights because it is being forced to defend the treatment of female employees regardless of the jobs they hold or where they work.	0
80nyt37	0	a	Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.	0
80fox10	0	a	"""Is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?"" he asked."	0
80hpo23	1	a	"""There is absolutely no way there can be a fair process here,"" Boutrous said."	1
80nyt46	0	a	The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers “how many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?”	0
80fox26	0	a	"""Our expert's report and testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there was no pay disparity,"" Boutrous told the court."	0
80nyt5	0	a	The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance.	0
80nyt4	0	a	The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court’s pro-business reputation.	0
80fox1	1	a	Although she may ultimately side with the plaintiffs, even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an ardent defender of women's rights, expressed some concerns about the particulars of the sex discrimination lawsuit that covers 1.5 million women and could cost the world's largest retailer billions of dollars.	1
80nyt43	0	a	“Is it true,” Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, “that Wal-Mart’s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?”	0
80nyt42	0	a	Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.	0
80hpo30	0	a	The business community has said that a ruling for the women would lead to a flood of class-action lawsuits based on vague evidence.	0
80nyt40	0	a	That is not a process known to our jurisprudence.	0
80hpo21	0	a	That split among the justices raised the prospect of an ideologically divided ruling by the court this summer.	0
80fox9	0	a	Chief Justice John Roberts also offered his doubts about the merits of lawsuit, suggesting that any discriminatory acts at Wal-Mart are no worse than anywhere else.	0
80hpo3	0	a	The case also could affect the future of other class-action lawsuits that pool modest individual claims into a single action that creates the potential for a large judgment and increases the pressure on businesses to settle.	0
80nyt34	0	a	Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart’s personnel decisions were “standardless” and “recordless.”	0
80nyt30	0	a	Several justices had practical concerns.	0
80hpo31	0	a	Supporters of the women say that if the court sides with Wal-Mart, it could remove a valuable weapon for fighting all sorts of discrimination.	0
80hpo28	0	a	Business interests have lined up with Wal-Mart while civil rights, women's and consumer groups have sided with the women plaintiffs.	0
80nyt50	0	a	“So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,” Justice Alito said.	0
80fox15	0	a	Two lower courts said the case could move toward trial.	0
80nyt48	0	a	Mr. Sellers responded that “there is no minimum number” in court decisions.	0
80nyt23	0	a	Mr. Sellers responded that “there is this broad discretion given the managers” but that “they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.” Managers, he went on, “are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.”	0
80fox16	0	a	Wal-Mart's appeal is asking the Supreme Court to stop the case from ever getting to a trial judge.	0
80nyt15	0	a	“Your complaint faces in two directions,” he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.	0
80fox18	0	a	"""Wal-Mart may be a big company and that is no doubt."	0

80fox5	0	a	"The lawsuit alleges that the company's corporate culture, described in court Tuesday as the ""Wal-Mart Way,"" fosters the advancement of male workers over their female counterparts."	0
80nyt13	0	a	In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs — who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications — do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.	0
80nyt49	0	a	Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.	0
80nyt27	0	a	“Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories,” he said.	0
80fox24	0	a	Much of the hour-long argument delved into the tedious details of class action law and if the Wal-Mart women could properly certify their claims into a single case.	0
80fox14	0	a	Her discrimination claims were folded into a class action lawsuit covering all current female Wal-Mart employees and any who worked for the company going back to late 1998.	0
80nyt11	0	a	Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable.	0
80nyt18	0	a	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces.	0
80fox22	0	a	Dukes's case has drawn the attention of the larger business community who fear that if the justices allow the case to proceed, it will open the doors to more class action lawsuits.	0

80hpo27	0	a	Their situations were discussed only briefly, with Boutrous noting how different they were as a way to argue they should not be dealt with in the same lawsuit.	0
80nyt14	0	a	Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated — through a central policy conferring local discretion — was internally inconsistent.	0
80nyt35	0	a	Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment.	0
80fox2	0	a	The key vote for a Wal-Mart victory could belong to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who said he was troubled by what he called an inconsistency in the women's lawsuit.	0

28nyt22	0	a	Mr. McCain defended Mr. Lieberman, who endorsed his 2008 run for president.	0
28nyt21	0	a	But casting Mr. Lieberman as the most likely choice did have one immediate advantage: It appealed to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who had suggested this week that the firestorm over Mr. Trump’s ouster of Mr. Comey was as bad as Watergate.	0

28nyt11	1	a	It was unclear whether the president’s acknowledgment that Mr. Lieberman was a finalist was intended to stoke the “Apprentice”-style frenzy of speculation he has favored with other high-profile picks, only to opt for a lesser-known candidate.	1
28hpo16	1	a	A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: “There couldn’t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician.	1

67nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — AARP, the powerful lobby for older Americans that has been seen as one of the leading opponents of Social Security benefit cuts, said on Friday that it was open to modest reductions in benefits for future recipients.	0
67hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The nation's leading advocate for senior citizens says that it hasn't wavered in its opposition to cutting Social Security benefits, though a top official with the group said it is open to a discussion about raising the retirement age and other changes.	0
67fox10	0	a	There is still plenty of space between the kind of plan Hutchison is calling for and what groups like the AARP would accept.	0
67nyt1	0	a	The group’s stance, which generated quick reaction from all sides because of its powerful voice on the issue, could provide added ammunition to fiscal conservatives who have sought unsuccessfully to restructure Social Security and chip away at the benefits it promises older Americans.	0
67nyt6	0	a	Nonetheless, the group’s openness to the possibility of unspecified cuts was seen as a significant development by people on all sides of the Social Security question because of AARP’s influence on federal policies affecting older Americans, including Medicare, prescription drugs and many more.	0
67nyt5	0	a	He made clear that the group’s willingness to discuss cuts comes with conditions: Reductions in benefits should be “minimal,” they should not affect current recipients and instead should be directed “far off in the future,” and they should be offset by increases in tax-generated revenue.	0
67hpo38	0	a	"UPDATE: AARP CEO A. Barry Rand said in a statement, ""It has long been AARP's policy that Social Security should be strengthened to provide adequate benefits and that it is sufficiently financed to ensure solvency with a stable trust fund for the next 75 years."""	0

67fox20	0	a	But the president's budget director told Fox News that even when the trust funds run out, both Social Security and Medicare would still have some income.	0
67hpo2	0	a	AARP initially pushed back against the newspaper's story.	0
67fox7	0	a	While the AARP claims its position on strengthening Social Security remains unchanged, others outside the organization detected a shift.	0
67hpo30	0	a	Social Security's retirement benefits are funded with taxes on incomes up to $106,800, known as the taxable earnings base.	0
67nyt18	1	a	The most recent projections from the Social Security Administration, issued last month, indicate that at the current rate, the program’s trust funds will be exhausted by 2036, and that $6.5 trillion in additional money will be needed over a 75-year period to pay all scheduled benefits.	1
67nyt3	0	a	Mr. Rother said the group’s stance on possible cuts, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal in Friday’s editions, should be seen less as a major change in position than as a reflection of the political and financial realities facing the Social Security system and the country as a whole.	0
67hpo20	0	a	"The official said that he and other opponents of benefit cuts had been told that AARP's ""longstanding position"" hadn't changed, but there was some uncertainty about what that position actually is."	0
67nyt22	0	a	While AARP has not issued specific recommendations or figures on how benefit reductions might be carried out, the group’s recent discussions with its members signal support for using increased revenue to fill two-thirds of the projected gap, and benefits reductions for one-third, Mr. Rother said.	0
67fox19	1	a	Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund last week warned the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2036 and under current law, seniors would then face a 23 percent across-the-board cut in benefits.	1

67hpo15	0	a	"Now that they have opened the door to reform, it is time for lawmakers to walk through it."""	0
67fox6	0	a	"However, AARP legislative policy director David Certner told Fox News that Social Security needs a ""package of revenue and benefit adjustments ... to make it solvent."""	0
67fox15	0	a	But the AARP has told Fox News that Hutchison's proposal is not acceptable.	0
67hpo26	1	a	Economists credit the program for drastically reducing poverty among the elderly since its creation in the 1930s.	1
67hpo37	1	a	That proposal went nowhere.	1
67fox2	0	a	The Wall Street Journal first reported Friday that the AARP, which opposed President George W. Bush's push to partially privatize Social Security, has decided to accept cuts -- though it would reportedly push for tax hikes to close most of the long-term Social Security shortfall.	0
67nyt9	0	a	But other advocacy groups that are pushing to preserve Social Security benefits accused AARP of effectively abandoning its core constituency.	0
67hpo18	0	a	"The top folks like to be in the inside game,"" one union official said."	0

67hpo19	1	a	"""But they are walking backwards now."""	1
67nyt25	1	a	While he did not directly address the question of possible cuts in benefits in his statement, Mr. Rand said his group would be working to evaluate any proposed changes in Social Security “to determine how each might — individually or in different combinations — impact the lives of current and future retirees.”	1
67hpo29	0	a	Rother's thinking, according to the paper, is that tax increases alone can't keep the program's $2.6 trillion trust fund from running out of money, so benefit cuts must be included as well.	0
67hpo9	0	a	"And we're certainly willing to talk about a package of changes that will keep Social Security strong."""	0
67nyt12	0	a	But Mr. Richtman said the group’s openness to considering future cuts would no doubt be used by deficit hawks to push for immediate cuts in Social Security benefits as part of the debate over deficit reduction.	0

98hpo5	0	a	"There won't be amnesty inside it."""	0
98fox7	0	a	The path to legalization’s inclusion in the plan – which House Republican leaders discussed as recently as Wednesday -- is particularly significant given that it is one of the pivotal reasons that plans last year to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law broke down in the House of Representatives after it passed in the Senate in June.	0
98fox11	0	a	Proponents of a pathway to legal status argued that the opportunity would be given only to those undocumented immigrants who earned it by meeting a strict set of criteria including paying fines, learning English, having a clean police record and paying taxes.	0

98nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — House Republicans are preparing to unveil their own broad template for overhauling the nation’s immigration system this week, potentially offering a small opening for President Obama and congressional Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation before the end of the year.	0
98hpo2	0	a	Although he's expressed openness to legal status previously, his comments could be a hint at what's to come in the House GOP's plan to soon release its own principles for immigration reform.	0
98nyt8	0	a	But heading into the three-day Republican retreat, even some of the most ardent conservatives say consensus is forming around an immigration package that would include several separate bills on border security; a clampdown against the hiring of undocumented workers; expanded guest-worker programs; a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children; and a path to legal status for undocumented workers with family ties to citizens or employer sponsors.	0
98nyt4	0	a	“The principles they lay out I’m sure won’t satisfy everybody,” Michael R. Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, said at an immigration forum on Friday.	0
98nyt3	0	a	The Republican effort comes as Mr. Obama is expected to push once again for an overhaul of the immigration system in his State of the Union address Tuesday, and as lawmakers from both parties describe immigration as one of the few potential areas for bipartisan compromise before the end of the current Congress.	0
98hpo8	0	a	Immigration activists have targeted McCarthy specifically due to his high rank in the House GOP.	0
98fox10	0	a	That created a fight among Republicans in Congress, with some – including conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a Tea Party lawmaker from Florida – arguing that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants was not a realistic option, and that not doing anything to bring them onto the radar amounted to an amnesty.	0
98fox6	0	a	The House Republican immigration principles reportedly will cover how the U.S. border should be protected, how immigration laws should be enforced inside the United States, and how many of the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants can embark on a path to legalize their status, according to various media stories.	0
98nyt1	0	a	Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders are expected to release a one-page statement of immigration principles this week at their annual retreat in Cambridge, Md., according to aides with knowledge of the plan.	0

2nyt11	0	a	Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, “I was a little new to the job.”	0
2fox2	0	a	The move is expected to face a swift and forceful legal challenge that could stall the attempt in the courts for the near future.	0
2fox21	0	a	Congress has the exclusive power of the purse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the President from spending money that has not been appropriated. ...	0
2nyt34	1	a	But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms.	1
2fox20	1	a	"""The President’s declaration of a national emergency would be an abuse of his constitutional oath and an affront to the separation of powers."	1
2fox38	1	a	Trump, though, has talked for weeks about taking executive action to divert money from other programs for wall construction, without congressional sign-off—despite his criticisms of former President Barack Obama for using executive action.	1
2nyt55	0	a	It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.”	0
2nyt65	0	a	Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.	0
2hpo7	0	a	To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.	0
2nyt70	0	a	But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization.	0
2nyt54	0	a	“This is authority given to the president in law already.	0
2nyt18	0	a	“And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.”	0

2nyt17	0	a	“People said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. Kim.	0
2fox15	0	a	But by declaring an emergency, Trump would also seek to unlock money from the Defense Department’s military construction budget, to the tune of $3.5 billion.	0
2nyt13	1	a	Mr. Trump’s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.	1
2nyt57	0	a	But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization.	0

2nyt9	1	a	Mr. Trump’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.	1
2hpo3	1	a	“I could do the wall over a longer period of time ― I didn’t need to do this,” Trump said in a televised speech, even as he contended the situation on the southern border amounted to a national emergency.	1
2nyt20	0	a	“Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him.	0
2fox28	0	a	But the deal would provide only a fraction of Trump’s originally proposed figure of $5.7 billion for border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the southern border.	0
2nyt44	0	a	“I don’t know her,” he said before quickly correcting himself. “I hardly know her.	0

2fox26	0	a	The president’s decision to declare a national emergency comes after a review of the spending package.	0
2fox33	0	a	From Dec. 22 through Jan. 25—for 35 days—the White House and congressional Democrats battled over border security funding.	0

2fox23	0	a	This is far from the only declared national emergency.	0
2nyt7	0	a	The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move.	0
2nyt52	0	a	Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress.	0
2hpo1	0	a	Trump, who was accompanied by parents of children killed by unauthorized immigrants, said he was declaring the national emergency for “virtual invasion purposes.”	0
2hpo0	0	a	President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border in an effort to unilaterally seize funding to begin building his long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico.	0
2nyt8	1	a	“This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement.	1

2nyt23	1	a	California and New York likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called the president’s “vanity project,” and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same.	1
2nyt32	0	a	Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress.	0
2nyt49	0	a	Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward.	0
2hpo28	0	a	There is no national emergency,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement.	0
2fox5	0	a	"Trump, in the Rose Garden, declared once again that ""walls work"" as he confirmed the emergency declaration would accompany the spending legislation."	0
2hpo2	0	a	But he also acknowledged another reason: He didn’t want to wait on Congress to approve the funds.	0
2nyt4	0	a	But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action.	0

2hpo22	0	a	A national emergency declaration grants a president the ability to circumvent certain government rules so that an administration can respond to a crisis.	0
2nyt58	0	a	White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W.

2fox27	0	a	The compromise package, which was negotiated for weeks in a bipartisan conference committee, passed both the House and the Senate on Thursday.	0
2hpo24	0	a	Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by “unlocking” new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.	0
2hpo34	0	a	In January, Trump asserted that he had “the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” according to CNN.	0
2hpo30	1	a	Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a “gross abuse of the power of the presidency” and vowed that “Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.”	1
2nyt2	0	a	“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought.	0
2nyt30	0	a	The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall.	0
2hpo35	0	a	He called it “the easy route” while insisting that he’d rather Congress approve his border wall funding.	0
2nyt28	0	a	The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it.	0
2fox34	0	a	Trump requested $5.7 billion for construction of the wall, while Democrats vowed to block any spending proposal that included such funding.	0
2nyt22	0	a	Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier.	0
2nyt67	0	a	Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration.	0
2nyt63	0	a	The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall.	0
2nyt10	1	a	The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not.	1
2nyt14	0	a	“The numbers that you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter.	0
2fox24	0	a	"According to the Congressional Research Service, there are at least 30 ""national emergencies"" in effect, including those concerning blocking Iranian government property, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other terror-related acts."	0
2fox25	0	a	But none of the emergencies have involved the president of the United States spending money that had not been specifically appropriated by Congress.	0
2hpo17	0	a	The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed.	0
2fox0	0	a	President Trump said Friday he is declaring a national emergency on the southern border, tapping into executive powers in a bid to divert billions toward construction of a wall even as he signs a funding package that includes just $1.4 billion for border security.	0
2hpo19	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision.	0
2hpo29	1	a	“If Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won’t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.”	1
2nyt37	0	a	The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land.	0
2nyt43	0	a	But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin.	0
2fox30	0	a	The package, as it stands, is enough to build just 55 miles of barrier.	0
2nyt33	0	a	The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans.	0
2nyt26	0	a	Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor.	0
2fox31	0	a	"And notably, the word ""wall"" does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials."	0
2hpo33	0	a	Trump reopened the government for three weeks on Jan. 25, allowing government workers to get back to work as border security negotiations continued.	0
2nyt68	1	a	Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so.	1
2nyt61	0	a	In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year.	0
2fox3	0	a	But the declaration and other money-moving plans allow Trump to continue to fight for border wall construction while also averting another partial government shutdown -- which would have been triggered at midnight absent the new funding package.	0
2fox13	0	a	That money has been described as “easy money” that the White House can use however it wants.	0

6fox5	0	a	Reid's comments added another high-profile voice to the mosque controversy.	0
6fox2	0	a	But at the same time, Manley put Reid on the record for the first time in the hyper-sensitive and volatile mosque debate.	0
6nyt25	0	a	Before Mr. Obama spoke out, leading Republican figures like Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, and Sarah Palin, the party’s 2008 vice-presidential nominee, had been voicing opposition to the Islamic center.	0
6nyt31	1	a	Democratic campaign officials accused Republicans of exploiting the Sept. 11 attacks, noting that their outrage over the Islamic center came just weeks after many House Republicans opposed a new medical program to monitor and treat emergency workers and others suffering ill effects from exposure to hazardous materials at ground zero.	1

6nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Republican Congressional candidates on Monday intensified efforts to inject the divide over construction of an Islamic center near ground zero into the midterm campaigns while the Senate’s top Democrat said he objected to the mosque being built there.	0
6nyt23	0	a	Two mosques, founded in 1970 and 1985, are already within several blocks of the proposed center.	0
6fox0	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid broke with President Obama Monday over the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, saying the controversial Islamic center should be built elsewhere.	0
6nyt5	0	a	In a number of releases and statements, Republican House and Senate candidates challenged Democrats like Mr. Reid to make their positions clear on the construction of a mosque and community center about two blocks from the site of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City.	0
6fox10	0	a	Republicans have since both criticized his position and pressured other Democrats to take a stand on the politically sticky issue, one where charges of insensitivity have flown on both sides.	0
6nyt22	0	a	The developer, Sharif el-Gamal, a real estate investor born in New York, has said the center would include meeting rooms, a prayer space, a 500-seat auditorium and a pool.	0
6hpo8	0	a	If anything, it's clearer now than it was last week (when Democrats were mostly silent on the matter) how deeply the party just wants this entire issue to go away.	0
6nyt26	0	a	That caused other Republicans to warn that the party risked a backlash and was alienating the nation’s Muslims.	0
6hpo4	0	a	"""The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,"" reads a statement from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's office (D-Nev.)."	0

6hpo9	1	a	Reid, after all, only issued the above statement after his Republican opponents began hitting him for going silent on the matter.	1
6nyt2	0	a	That separates Mr. Reid from President Obama’s support of the developers’ right to build the center.	0
6nyt19	1	a	Mr. Nadler, whose view is that the developers were entitled to build the mosque at the selected location if they choose, said, “Ultimately I suspect that once this simmers down in a few weeks, people will realize that everybody’s liberty is at stake here.”	1

6nyt16	0	a	Some also said the White House should not have put lawmakers on the spot in the first place and could have been better prepared for the president’s statement, lining up religious and community leaders to offer support for the right to build the mosque and undermine Republican attacks.	0

83hpo21	0	a	The situation left House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the rest of the Republican leadership in the House with a problem: The 40 or so hardline tea party members of the House GOP do not want the response to Cantor's loss -- which was driven by grassroots discontent with the establishment -- to simply be more establishment leadership.	0

83hpo25	0	a	A Labrador bid helps all parties regardless of the outcome -- including Labrador himself, since a run will elevate him as a leader inside the House GOP.	0
83hpo19	0	a	He too declined to run, sensing McCarthy's near inevitability.	0
83fox28	0	a	Labrador says this about himself on his website: “Born to a single mother in Puerto Rico, Raúl Labrador moved with his mother to the mainland U.S. at age 13.”	0
83fox18	0	a	Nonetheless, many see the next majority leader as potentially influencing the House handling of immigration reform, which stalled as conservative members said they would not support a comprehensive measure for an overhaul of the system, and especially not one that, in their view, would grant amnesty to lawbreakers.	0
83fox26	0	a	Labrador supports a path to legal status, but only after evidence that enforcement has been improved, he has said.	0

30hpo11	0	a	According to the report issued by the Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Lerner had to correct the criteria developed by the Cincinnati office twice because she and other top IRS officials found that they were using politically fraught terms as they sought to make sure groups were properly applying for tax exemption.	0
30nyt30	0	a	At times, committee members could hardly conceal their contempt for the I.R.S. and the Obama White House.	0
30fox12	0	a	In the 1990's, Lerner also served as chief of enforcement at the Federal Elections Commission.	0
30nyt34	0	a	Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said the way that applicants for tax-exempt status were buried in I.R.S. paperwork reminded him of another sore point that Republicans have with the Obama administration.	0

30nyt4	0	a	I have not broken any laws,” said Ms. Lerner, who leads the I.R.S.’s division on tax-exempt organizations.	0
30fox6	0	a	She said she hadn't revealed the information sooner, because she was never asked.	0
30nyt6	1	a	Ms. Lerner has become a person of intense interest to Congressional investigators, who insist that she made, at best, incomplete statements when she said she first learned that her subordinates had singled out Tea Party groups after reading news media reports last year.	1
30nyt20	0	a	And as the hearing continued, Republicans and Democrats pressed ahead with one point on which they agree these days: that an inept I.R.S. had committed serious misdeeds.	0
30fox20	0	a	Lerner said at Wednesday's hearing that she had done nothing wrong.	0
30nyt13	0	a	But when she declined, he dismissed her again.	0
30nyt10	0	a	“You don’t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination,” said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.	0
30hpo16	0	a	Chairman Issa remains hopeful that she will ultimately decide to testify tomorrow about her knowledge of outrageous IRS targeting of Americans for their political beliefs.”	0
30nyt37	0	a	“We know where that will lead. It will lead to a special prosecutor,” he said.	0
30fox2	0	a	Members of Congress are calling her evasive, and question why she didn't reveal the program sooner -- plus her history at the Federal Elections Commission is coming under scrutiny.	0
30nyt17	0	a	And he may elect to do so, given the objections of some Republicans on Wednesday after he dismissed her.	0
30hpo3	0	a	Since she will be pleading the Fifth, Taylor has asked the committee that she be excused from testifying.	0
30nyt44	0	a	“The Easter Egg Roll with my kids,” he said.	0
30fox4	0	a	It was the first time the agency acknowledged the practice.	0
30fox8	0	a	"Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., asked her if she could ""comment briefly on the status on the IRS investigation into these political not-for-profits."""	0
30hpo7	0	a	Issa has issued a subpoena to compel Lerner to appear at the hearing.	0
30fox22	0	a	"""I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee."""	0
30nyt5	0	a	“I have not violated any I.R.S. rules and regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other Congressional committee.”	0
30nyt9	0	a	But that upset other Republicans, who said that Ms. Lerner should not be let go so quickly.	0
30nyt22	0	a	Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the committee, also scolded the agency.	0
30nyt42	0	a	“One hundred-eighteen visits and it didn’t come up in casual conversation?” Mr. Jordan said.	0
30nyt16	0	a	Mr. Issa said he reserved the right to recall Ms. Lerner later.	0
30nyt21	0	a	“The power to tax is the power to destroy,” Mr. Issa said.	0
30nyt27	0	a	The hearing, the second this week on the I.R.S.’s efforts to target conservative groups, offered few new revelations.	0
30nyt23	1	a	“I believe there was gross incompetence and mismanagement,” he said.	1
30nyt39	0	a	Later, Mr. Jordan pressed Mr. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner, on whether he had visited the White House.	0
30nyt41	0	a	Was he sure, Mr. Jordan asked, that the I.R.S. targeting never came up?	0
30fox1	0	a	Now under the protection of her lawyers and the Fifth Amendment, Lois Lerner is facing a maelstrom of controversy.	0
30fox5	0	a	"""They used names like Tea Party or patriots ... and they selected cases simply because the application had those names in the title,"" she admitted."	0
30nyt2	0	a	As the official, Lois Lerner, appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, she sternly told her questioners that accusations that she had misled Congress in previous testimony were false.	0
30hpo10	0	a	"The criteria directed the IRS to conduct a more intensive review of applications for tax-exempt status from groups with the name ""tea party"" or ""patriot."""	0
30fox18	1	a	"""She was in effect being promoted for what she had done at the Federal Election Commission and now was going to be expected ... to replicate that at the IRS and now we know that's exactly what happened,"" he said."	1
30nyt26	0	a	“I think we need to be very, very careful not to let partisanship undermine the integrity not only of the committee but our investigation and our work product,” he said.	0
30nyt32	1	a	“This administration, which told us and told the American people that the attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi was the work, was caused by a video, is now the same administration who expects us to believe that this scandal was just the result of two rogue agents in Cincinnati,” he said.	1
30fox21	0	a	"""I have not done anything wrong,"" she said."	0
30hpo14	0	a	“The Committee has been contacted by Ms. Lerner’s lawyer who stated that his client intended to invoke her 5th amendment right and refuse to answer questions,” Oversight and Government Reform Committee spokesman Ali Ahmad said in a statement.	0
30fox14	0	a	The Christian Coalition won, but in one deposition, FEC lawyers asked a defendant if televangelist Pat Robertson prayed for him.	0
30nyt24	0	a	“We are better than that. We are simply better than that.”	0
30hpo2	0	a	"""She has not committed any crime or made any misrepresentation but under the circumstances she has no choice but to take this course,"" the letter addressed to Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) reads, according to the Los Angeles Times."	0
30fox7	0	a	But just two days before the ABA conference, Lerner was specifically asked about the investigation.	0
30hpo13	0	a	"It also follows a request to Lerner from the committee to provide information on why she gave ""false or misleading information"" to the committee on four previous occasions in 2012."	0
30nyt36	0	a	One Democrat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, even raised the threat of appointing a special prosecutor if Congress continues to feel that the I.R.S. is not being straightforward.	0
30hpo4	1	a	"The letter from Taylor states that her testimony would ""have no purpose other than to embarrass or burden her."""	1
30nyt28	0	a	Mr. George did shed some light on the extent of the accusations against the I.R.S., saying that at this point in this investigation he had no reason to believe any illegal conduct occurred.	0
30hpo5	0	a	The Wednesday hearing would have been Lerner's first public appearance, and first under oath, since she apologized for the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative groups at a May 10 American Bar Association meeting.	0
30nyt15	0	a	That exchange set the tone for a contentious hearing that veered into veiled accusations that the White House had a larger role in the controversy than previously disclosed, as well as outright attacks on President Obama’s character.	0
30hpo1	0	a	Lerner announced her plans to plead the Fifth during her testimony in a letter from her lawyer, William Taylor III, to the committee.	0
30hpo15	0	a	“Ms. Lerner remains under subpoena from Chairman Issa to appear at tomorrow’s hearing — the Committee has a Constitutional obligation to conduct oversight.	0
30nyt11	0	a	“She ought to stand here and answer our questions.”	0
30fox10	0	a	Crowley later called her answer evasive.	0
30nyt35	0	a	“Man, that sounds like the Keystone Pipeline to me,” he said, referring to the proposed cross-country oil pipeline that the president has so far declined to approve.	0
30nyt31	0	a	Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, tried to link the I.R.S. scandal with other controversies that are dogging the Obama administration.	0
30nyt38	0	a	“There will be hell to pay if that’s the route we choose to go down.”	0
30nyt8	0	a	After she refused on Wednesday to say anything more to the committee, despite attempts by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committee’s Republican chairman, to persuade her otherwise, Mr. Issa tried to dismiss her and her lawyer.	0
30nyt33	0	a	“The people don’t buy it.”	0
30nyt1	0	a	She then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a House hearing on the agency’s actions.	0
30nyt43	0	a	In follow-up questioning by Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, Mr. Shulman offered what he said was one of the many plausible explanations why he would have visited the White House.	0
30nyt18	0	a	They argued that by making an opening statement, she had waived her Fifth Amendment right and could be compelled to testify, a contention Ms. Lerner’s lawyer disputed.	0
30fox0	0	a	The IRS official who refused to testify at a House hearing Wednesday has become a key focus of the congressional investigations into the IRS practice of singling out conservative groups.	0
30nyt7	0	a	An inspector general’s report found, however, that she was briefed on their actions as early as June 2011.	0
30nyt12	0	a	Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind.	0
30hpo9	0	a	As director of the IRS exempt organizations unit, she is in charge of the division overseeing nonprofit organizations, which includes the Cincinnati office that was the source of the inappropriate targeting criteria.	0
30nyt29	0	a	“We do not deem it illegal. We do not believe that it was illegal, what they did,” he said.	0
30nyt25	0	a	But Mr. Cummings also admonished his Republican colleagues.	0
30hpo8	0	a	Lerner is a key figure in the unfolding IRS scandal.	0
30fox16	0	a	"""Both political activity and religious activity are specifically protected by the First Amendment,"" he said."	0
30nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress.	0
30hpo12	0	a	Lerner's decision to plead the Fifth comes as the Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into whether laws were broken at the IRS, according to Taylor's letter to the committee.	0
30nyt19	0	a	The committee also heard testimony from Douglas H. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner; Neal S. Wolin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department; and J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general who looked into the accusations of targeting.	0

30hpo0	0	a	Lois Lerner, the director of the exempt organizations unit at the Internal Revenue Service, plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment during her expected testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reports.	0
30fox3	0	a	Lerner touched off the public controversy when, at an American Bar Association conference earlier this month, she apologized for the IRS' practice of targeting conservative organizations for additional scrutiny.	0

46hpo13	0	a	Trump and his lawyer, John Dowd, now claim that the president already knew about Flynn lying to the FBI, renewing questions of whether Trump obstructed justice in the investigation.	0
46hpo12	0	a	Flynn stepped down in February, saying that he had misled the transition team, including then Vice President-elect Mike Pence, about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials, which included discussing sanctions and the creation of a backchannel with the Kremlin.	0

46fox4	1	a	The president, without offering specifics, said his 2016 Democratic rival “lied many times” during her FBI interview in early July.	1

46hpo16	0	a	In an interview with Axios published Monday, Dowd brought out a new defense: Trump isn’t guilty of obstructing justice because he is the president.	0
46hpo17	0	a	The “President cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution’s Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,” Dowd said.	0

69hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The classified version of a State Department review of last year's assault on an American compound in Benghazi, Libya, found that it was impossible to say what exactly motivated the attackers, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revealed Wednesday.	0
69fox32	0	a	"""I'm not aware of anyone within my office, within the secretary's office, having seen the cable."""	0
69nyt27	0	a	Mr. McCain asserted that the Obama administration’s aversion to nation-building had precluded it from providing the kind of training and assistance that would have helped the fledgling Libyan government in Tripoli confront growing security threats from militants.	0
69nyt19	0	a	Since then, she has committed herself to putting in place all of the recommendations of an independent review that was led by Thomas R. Pickering, a former American ambassador, and Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.	0

69nyt11	0	a	In essence, Mrs. Clinton’s approach was to accept the responsibility for security lapses in Benghazi but not the blame.	0
69fox24	0	a	"But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said ""any suggestion that this is a budget issue is off base, or political."""	0
69hpo8	0	a	The Times later stood by that version of events, citing it in its fact-check of Republican attacks on Obama during the presidential campaign.	0
69fox25	0	a	Other lawmakers further complained that the State Department has spent millions on lower-priority projects that could have been spent on security.	0

69fox22	0	a	Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role.	0
69hpo11	0	a	In citing the classified report to rebuff congressional queries about the administration's handling of the crisis, Clinton was drawing on a powerful tool of her office, although discussing a classified document is sure to raise further questions.	0
69fox41	0	a	Republicans argue the Aug. 16 cable was rather high priority.	0
69fox11	0	a	For that year, the budget was $640 million.	0
69fox16	0	a	Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip, from $11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $10.1 million the following year.	0
69nyt2	1	a	“As I have said many times, I take responsibility, and nobody is more committed to getting this right,” she said, reading a statement during a day of testimony before Senate and House committees.	1
69nyt21	0	a	One of the sharpest exchanges of the day came when Mrs. Clinton responded to questions from Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, by saying there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attack had been characterized in its early hours and not enough on how to prevent a recurrence.	0
69nyt8	0	a	The continuing controversy over the attack, which resulted in the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, has cast a cloud over Mrs. Clinton’s final months at the State Department.	0
69fox9	0	a	But Congress often scales back the administration's requests, and not just for the State Department.	0
69fox21	0	a	"Asked again about budget issues, Lamb said: ""Sir, if it's a volatile situation, we will move assets to cover that."""	0
69fox28	0	a	That cable is seen as one of the vital warnings sent out of Libya in the months leading up to the attack.	0
69hpo10	0	a	But the classified version, Clinton said, detailed the possible motivations for the attack, and suggested while they were pre-coordinated and deliberate, they were also opportunistic and not planned extensively.	0
69nyt12	0	a	“I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department,” Mrs. Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning.	0

69nyt20	0	a	For all of the hours of testimony, the hearings did little to clarify the role of the White House in overseeing the American presence in Libya before the attack or explain why the Pentagon had few forces available on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to respond quickly to any assault on diplomatic outposts in the region.	0
69nyt22	1	a	Republicans have repeatedly charged that Obama administration officials deliberately played down the attack, focusing much of their criticism on Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations and once Mr. Obama’s choice to succeed Mrs. Clinton.	1
69nyt18	0	a	Mrs. Clinton first publicly took responsibility for the Sept. 11 attack in an Oct. 15 interview with television reporters.	0

69fox19	0	a	"Asked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force, she said: ""No."""	0
69hpo14	0	a	"""There are key questions surrounding the identity, actions and motivations of the perpetrators that remain to be determined,"" she said."	0
69fox17	0	a	Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.	0
69fox27	0	a	"That cable summarized an emergency meeting the day before by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi and warned the consulate could not defend against a ""coordinated attack."""	0
69fox35	0	a	And this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office.	0
69nyt24	1	a	What difference, at this point, does it make?” Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising.	1
69nyt29	0	a	Mrs. Clinton responded that Congress had delayed aid to Libya and said she would provide a list of steps that had been taken to train and equip Libyan forces.	0
69fox44	0	a	"""Had I been president at the time, and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post."	0

69fox30	0	a	"""That cable did not come to my attention."	0
69nyt9	0	a	It also has enormous political implications for Mrs. Clinton, the former New York senator who is already regarded as the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination if she chooses to run.	0
69fox29	1	a	But, to the dismay of lawmakers, Clinton repeatedly said she never saw it.	1
69nyt30	0	a	A persistent line of questioning by Republican lawmakers concerned the initial comments from Ms. Rice that the attack might have resulted from a protest, over an anti-Islamic video, that spun out of control.	0

69nyt37	0	a	Mrs. Clinton sought to put the events in Benghazi in a regional context, noting the presence of a group in northern Mali affiliated with Al Qaeda.	0
69nyt10	0	a	It was the first time she had faced extensive questioning about her role in the episode.	0
69nyt15	0	a	When the question of her role was taken up again in the afternoon hearing by Representative Ed Royce, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had been briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack.	0

69fox31	0	a	"I have made it very clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level,"" Clinton said."	0
69nyt34	0	a	To avoid the perception of a conflict of interest, the hearing on Wednesday was led by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, the incoming chairman, and Mr. Kerry did not attend.	0

69hpo5	1	a	That the administration wavered over its public declarations of the cause of the assault -- repeatedly citing the video before eventually confirming that it was clearly an act of terrorism -- was widely interpreted among critics as evidence of a desire to suppress or conceal the truth.	1
69nyt26	0	a	Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, began his questions by saying, “It’s wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever,” and then proceeded to complain that she had failed to answer lingering questions.	0

69nyt1	0	a	WASHINGTON — In one of her final appearances as secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday vigorously defended her handling of last September’s attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans and prompted a scathing review of State Department procedures.	0
69fox10	0	a	And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004.	0
69fox3	0	a	One issue that may come up is the department's funding.	0
69fox8	0	a	Democrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years, and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested.	0
69fox1	0	a	Republicans are challenging a host of statements made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Democratic allies during Wednesday's heated Libya testimony -- claiming that complaints about a lack of funding are bogus and questioning the secretary's insistence she never saw urgent cables warning about the danger of an attack.	0

37nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, drew fierce criticism and a call for his resignation on Friday after declaring at a party fund-raiser that the United States was on the wrong side of history with its conflict in Afghanistan, a military fight he called “a war of Obama’s choosing.”	0
37hpo11	0	a	Kristol’s was the harshest of all the reactions to the Steele, whose spokesman, it should be noted, tried to clarify the comment by insisting that he merely meant that President Obama has not been forthcoming with a winning strategy. 	0
37nyt10	0	a	He added, “Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not ‘a war of Obama’s choosing.’	0
37fox13	0	a	"... And, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war."""	0
37hpo20	1	a	He is the figurehead of the Republican Party whose tenure, once again, seems shaky.	1
37hpo1	0	a	The pushback crested with Bill Kristol — still an influential voice among Republican lawmakers — writing a letter to Steele on his Weekly Standard site calling for the RNC leader’s resignation.	0
37nyt4	0	a	Mr. Steele, seeking to clarify his remarks, issued a statement on Friday afternoon, saying, “There is no question that America must win the war on terror.”	0
37nyt12	0	a	He added, “There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they’re certainly entitled to make their case.	0
37nyt1	0	a	“This is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in,” Mr. Steele said in a speech Thursday night in Connecticut in which he offered a strong critique of President Obama’s military strategy.	0
37nyt11	0	a	It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.”	0
37hpo12	0	a	But the Weekly Standard editor was not alone.	0
37nyt14	1	a	A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Brad Woodhouse, said Mr. Steele was “betting against our troops and rooting for failure in Afghanistan.”	1
37hpo6	0	a	And not on a trivial matter.	0
37nyt18	0	a	The video appears to have been taken by a hidden camera at an event that was closed to the press.	0
37hpo13	0	a	Another major neoconservative figure, Dan Senor, told the Huffington Post that Steele’s comments are “utterly irresponsible.”	0
37fox12	0	a	"Trying to quell the furor, Steele issued a statement saying: ""There is no question that America must win the war on terror."	0
37nyt19	0	a	Republican officials did not dispute the authenticity of the video, but disputed its characterization.	0
37hpo7	1	a	At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment.	1
37fox8	0	a	"He called Steele's comments ""unacceptable"" and ""inaccurate."""	0
37hpo0	0	a	Several prominent conservatives offered swift, negative reactions to Michael Steele on Friday, after the RNC chairman was caught on camera saying that Afghanistan is a largely unwinnable war of President Obama’s choosing. 	0
37nyt7	0	a	Mr. Obama shifted the focus on the war on terrorism from Iraq to Afghanistan and last year announced his plan to send 30,000 more troops there.	0
37nyt17	0	a	Linda McMahon, the party’s candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut, was in the audience, along with other leading state Republicans.	0
37hpo16	1	a	“It’s completely inconsistent with this latest statement,” summarized Senor. 	1
37fox4	0	a	"""This is America's war."	0
37hpo3	0	a	It has been prosecuted by the United States under Presidents Bush and Obama.	0

37hpo9	0	a	There are, of course, those who think we should pull out of Afghanistan, and they’re certainly entitled to make their case.	0
37nyt16	0	a	When Mr. Steele made the remarks, he was speaking to Republican contributors at a fund-raiser in Connecticut.	0
37nyt8	0	a	Mr. Steele’s comments prompted William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and a leading voice of conservative support for the war in Afghanistan, to call for Mr. Steele’s resignation as party leader.	0
37nyt5	1	a	His remarks were the latest in a string of controversial statements that he has made as party chairman.	1
37hpo2	0	a	“Needless to say, the war in Afghanistan was not “a war of Obama’s choosing.”	0
37hpo21	0	a	Shortly after Kristol called for his resignation, a GOP operative began pitching the column to reporters, hoping that the meme of Steele’s troubles would spread far and wide.	0
37hpo19	0	a	But Steele is not an anti-war Democrat. Nor is he a pundit.	0
37hpo17	0	a	In a bit of irony, Steele’s most recent comments have actually resonated among anti-war Democrats who share the skepticism that Afghanistan is a winnable enterprise.	0
37nyt15	0	a	Republican officials dismissed that criticism.	0
37hpo4	0	a	Republicans have consistently supported the effort.	0
37fox0	0	a	"Republican senators kept up pressure on party Chairman Michael Steele Sunday to better explain -- and publicly apologize for -- his on-camera claim that Afghanistan is a ""war of Obama's choosing"" and may not be winnable."	0
37nyt22	0	a	“For the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war,” Mr. Steele said.	0
37fox16	0	a	"Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who led the charge of conservatives calling for Steele to step down over the remark, said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Steele still needs to go -- though he said Steele tried to convince him otherwise."	0
37nyt9	1	a	“Your tenure has, of course, been marked by gaffes and embarrassments, but I for one have never paid much attention to them, and have never thought they would matter much to the success of the causes and principles we share,” Mr. Kristol wrote Friday.	1
37hpo5	0	a	Indeed, as the DNC Communications Director (of all people) has said, your statement “puts [you] at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party.	0
37hpo10	0	a	But one of them shouldn’t be the chairman of the Republican party.”	0
37hpo15	0	a	Indeed, even Steele himself declared back in December that Afghanistan is “’a war we have to win” — a far cry from the comments he made Thursday night, in which he said: “...you don’t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan, alright, because everyone who’s tried over a thousand years of history has failed.” 	0

26nyt36	0	a	It was the president’s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall — and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.	0

26hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new Congress on Wednesday with no end in sight.	0
26fox11	0	a	He offered some flexibility only on what the wall would be made of, saying it could be concrete or steel.	0
26nyt9	0	a	The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats — poised to assume control of the House on Thursday — who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump’s immigration policies.	0
26fox20	0	a	Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers. 	0
26hpo3	0	a	“They are now feeling the heat,” Schumer said.	0
26hpo23	0	a	Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it ― even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.	0

26hpo27	0	a	Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump’s claims.	0
26nyt3	0	a	He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.	0
26nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting — the first in 22 days — could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump’s demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.	0
26nyt45	1	a	“Walls work,” he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one “around his compound” in Washington.	1
26nyt52	1	a	“This morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,” Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.	1

26nyt12	0	a	“It’s too important a subject to walk away from.”	0
26nyt2	0	a	“I would look foolish if I did that,” Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity.	0
26nyt44	0	a	“The United States needs a physical barrier,” the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to “a sieve” that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.	0
26nyt34	0	a	Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.	0
26nyt50	0	a	Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.	0
26nyt32	0	a	The larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.	0
26nyt20	0	a	Mr. Trump’s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22.	0
26nyt26	0	a	Let’s get it done!”	0
26fox16	0	a	"Trump later said the group would ""determine what we're going to do about the border."" "	0
26fox15	0	a	Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend. 	0
26fox18	1	a	The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump’s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives. 	1
26nyt10	0	a	With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.	0
26hpo9	0	a	About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote.	0

26nyt23	0	a	A second official who attended said Mr. Trump’s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker.	0
26fox25	0	a	“Americans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration. 	0
26nyt35	0	a	Wednesday’s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion.	0
26nyt14	1	a	“He could not give a good answer,” Mr. Schumer said.	1
26nyt37	0	a	But it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.	0
26fox14	0	a	"She said there had been progress only in the sense of a ""better understanding"" of each other."	0
26hpo8	0	a	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.	0
26nyt21	0	a	It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.	0
26nyt13	0	a	Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: “We are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?”	0
26hpo1	0	a	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border.	0
26nyt11	0	a	“Could be a long time, or it could be quickly,” Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown.	0
26nyt48	0	a	Outside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent.	0
26nyt47	1	a	Mr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.	1
26nyt6	0	a	The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.	0
26hpo5	0	a	“We’re asking the president to open the government,” she told reporters on the White House driveway.	0
26hpo18	1	a	Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis’ performance and the late Sen. John McCain’s vote against Trump’s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.	1
26hpo17	0	a	Trump’s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019.	0
26nyt4	0	a	Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion.	0
26fox10	0	a	"He said it could be opened ""very quickly"" if they come to an agreement on the wall. "	0
26nyt54	1	a	“I came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,” she said.	1
26fox0	0	a	"President Trump stood firm Friday on his demands for a border wall after the second White House meeting with congressional leaders this week broke up with no apparent deal, warning Democrats the partial government shutdown could last ""years"" and saying he could even declare a ""national emergency"" to bypass Congress if necessary."	0
26hpo11	0	a	Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.	0
26nyt30	0	a	“No, not $2.5 billion, no — we’re asking for $5.6” billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.	0
26fox34	0	a	"White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on ""Fox & Friends"" earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment."	0
26hpo14	1	a	Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.	1
26fox26	0	a	Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first,” he wrote.	0
26hpo26	0	a	In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.	0
26nyt24	0	a	Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.	0
26nyt38	0	a	Mr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen’s statistics, two of the officials said.	0
26hpo6	0	a	“We are giving him a Republican path to do that.	0
26hpo28	0	a	Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall.	0
26fox3	0	a	"The press conference underscored how far apart both sides are, even as Trump called the meeting ""productive"" and suggested the standoff could end soon -- or not. "	0
26fox1	0	a	“We can call a national emergency [to build a border wall] because of the security of our country,” Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden, during a lengthy and impromptu press conference.	0
26hpo2	0	a	On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump.	0
26fox33	0	a	“We need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre,” he told reporters.	0
26hpo20	1	a	The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.	1
26hpo16	0	a	When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “As long as it takes,” calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of “national security.”	0
26fox30	1	a	"""There is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck,"" she said"	1
26fox21	0	a	Ahead of the meeting Trump sent a letter to members of Congress congratulating Pelosi on her election as speaker and calling on Congress to re-open the government.	0
26hpo21	0	a	Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it.	0
26nyt16	1	a	At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was “a good Catholic” and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.	1
26fox35	0	a	“We think we're hopeful because the people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games,” she said. 	0
26fox5	0	a	"""This is national security we’re talking about, we’re not talking about games,"" he told reporters. "	0
26nyt1	0	a	During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats’ proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.	0
26nyt49	0	a	Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown’s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.	0
26fox7	0	a	"Despite Trump saying conversations had ""come a long way,"" Democrats were more dour in their assessment. "	0
26nyt31	1	a	His rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.	1
26fox36	0	a	“They elected her to find real solutions and actually work with the president and work with all members of Congress to get things done.”	0
26nyt17	0	a	In her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government.	0
26nyt19	0	a	The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.	0
26nyt41	1	a	“Democrats in the room either don’t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,” Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night.	1
26hpo29	0	a	More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.	0
26nyt15	0	a	Mr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall.	0
26fox2	0	a	“I may do it,” he said, before adding, “If we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving it a shot.”	0
26fox12	0	a	"""Steel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like we’re talking about steel because the other side feels better about it,"" he said."	0
26fox29	0	a	"""The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" Pelosi said at an MSNBC Town Hall."	0
26hpo25	0	a	In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the “bollard fencing” developed during President Barack Obama’s administration.	0
26nyt51	0	a	Incoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown’s effect.	0
26fox19	0	a	Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall.	0
26fox32	1	a	McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills “a time-wasting act of political posturing” and said that “a resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.”	1
26nyt18	0	a	One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September.	0
26hpo19	1	a	Trump’s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.	1
26hpo7	1	a	Why would he not do that?”	1
26fox28	0	a	Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall.	0
26hpo24	0	a	During the campaign, he promised a “great, great” wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath.	0
26nyt22	0	a	The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting.	0
26fox22	0	a	"“As we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders,"" he said. "	0
26fox4	1	a	"He indicated he was not shifting on his demand for more than $5 billion for funding for a wall on the southern border, saying it was necessary as the border is a ""dangerous, horrible disaster."""	1
26fox8	0	a	"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them ""he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”"	0
26nyt46	0	a	(Parts of Mr. Obama’s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)	0
26nyt5	0	a	Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security.	0
26nyt33	0	a	But inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle.	0
26hpo12	0	a	In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed “essential” and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances.	0
26nyt25	0	a	In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: “I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.	0
26nyt42	1	a	“It was incredibly disheartening that they don’t want to know the facts when making policy.”	1
26nyt39	0	a	Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.	0
26hpo15	0	a	Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.	0
26fox31	0	a	The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership. 	0
26hpo4	0	a	Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.	0
26nyt28	0	a	Before he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient.	0
26fox17	0	a	That group would include Vice President Pence and advisor Jared Kushner.	0
26nyt29	0	a	In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.	0
26nyt40	0	a	The back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.	0
26fox37	0	a	"On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' “Tucker Carlson Tonight” that the terms of the negotiations were clear: ""Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal."""	0

26nyt43	0	a	Yet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.	0

88nyt0	0	a	PHOENIX — As the Arizona Legislature sent a bill to her desk Monday that would grant business owners the right to invoke religion to refuse service to gays and others, Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, faced pressure from many corners to veto the measure, which has cast unwanted national attention on Arizona.	0
88fox8	0	a	There is widespread speculation that Brewer will veto the bill, but she has not said how she'll act, as is her longtime practice with pending legislation.	0

88nyt14	0	a	Among the Republicans vying to succeed Ms. Brewer, who cannot run for re-election because of term limits, there was broad consensus against the measure, which would expand the state’s definition of “exercise of religion” to protect businesses and citizens from lawsuits after denying services on religious grounds.	0

52fox4	0	a	BuzzFeed published the story on Thursday, citing two law enforcement officials who said Cohen -- Trump’s former longtime attorney -- acknowledged to Mueller’s office that he was told to lie to Congress about the potential real-estate deal in Moscow, telling Congress that the negotiations ended months before they did so as to conceal Trump’s involvement.	0
52nyt10	0	a	The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel’s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.	0

52nyt5	0	a	A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia’s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.	0

41nyt2	0	a	In short, both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have adopted the favored position of their ideological base on a subject that profoundly animates both of those camps.	0
41hpo14	0	a	Romney told a local Denver TV station earlier on Wednesday that he opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions.	0

72hpo7	0	a	Obama has yet to make an endorsement in the race, but White House officials have said that it could come as early as this week.	0

72fox23	0	a	White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said Sanders has the right to make campaign decisions on his own timeline.	0
72fox4	0	a	The president made clear he would no longer stand on the sidelines, even as Vermont Sen. Sanders vows to stick out the race at least through the final primary in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday.	0
72nyt16	1	a	His face flushed, Mr. Sanders did not speak at all.	1
72fox29	0	a	He lamented childhood poverty rates, crushing college debt, crumbling infrastructure and other woes and said these are the issues he’ll bring to the Philadelphia convention.	0
72nyt14	0	a	“There’s a natural process of everybody recognizing that this is not about any individual.”	0

39nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats on Thursday vowed to filibuster the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, signaling an imminent partisan showdown over the nominee’s fate and the future of century-old rules in the chamber.	0
39hpo1	0	a	Nominees have, in turn, generally refused to answer any question directly, in an appparent fear of revealing any bias about a potential future case they may hear.	0
39nyt13	0	a	“Despite the judge’s outstanding performance, his exceptional background, and the extensive support he’s received from people of all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation process,” Mr. McConnell said of Judge Gorsuch.	0
39fox0	0	a	As Senate Democrats float new options for complicating a vote on President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Republicans appear ready to return fire with a bomb of their own – a nuclear one.	0
39nyt19	0	a	Since the evening Judge Gorsuch was nominated, liberal groups have been pressuring Democrats to filibuster the vote on him.	0
39nyt22	0	a	To eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, Republicans would need to vote in virtual lock step: The party effectively has only 51 votes right now because one member, Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, is recuperating from back surgery, so just two Republican senators could block a rules change.	0
39fox17	0	a	“If Judge Gorsuch can’t achieve 60 votes in the Senate, could any judge appointed by a Republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the Senate?” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asked on Tuesday.	0
39hpo9	0	a	The Democrats’ argument was instead directed at both their base and their caucus to provide a clear rationale for opposing the nominee ― no matter his qualifications.	0
39hpo3	0	a	Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee took a different tack.	0
39nyt15	0	a	On Thursday, representatives of the American Bar Association told the committee that it had unanimously found Judge Gorsuch to be “well qualified,” the group’s highest rating.	0
39nyt32	0	a	Despite the escalating political friction, the atmosphere in the hearing room on Thursday was often more perfunctory than passionate, as panels of witnesses selected by Democrats and Republicans alternately expressed concerns that Judge Gorsuch was too conservative or praised him as a well-qualified and careful judge.	0
39hpo34	0	a	The Roberts Court has done much to reshape power in the United States.	0
39fox16	0	a	Republican Senate leaders so far have refrained from using the term – but their exasperated rhetoric shows they’re at least kicking the tires of a legislative Enola Gay.	0
39nyt21	0	a	Republicans have cited this history often in accusing their colleagues of hypocrisy on Judge Gorsuch.	0
39nyt14	1	a	During the four days of hearings, even Judge Gorsuch’s critics did not dispute his credentials.	1
39fox2	0	a	“We will do what is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, yes,” he told Fox News’ Shannon Bream on “America’s Newsroom,” when asked if they’d go that route.	0
39nyt29	0	a	“I’m going to keep on my theme I’ve been on for a couple of months,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri.	0
39fox20	0	a	Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., meanwhile, lamented the increasing politicization of Supreme Court nominations and implored his Democratic colleagues to vote on the man – not the party of the president who nominated him.	0
39nyt30	0	a	“I’m not going to talk about Gorsuch.”	0
39fox10	0	a	But Democrats could still try and filibuster, requiring Gorsuch to garner 60 “yea” votes in the Senate.	0
39hpo25	0	a	Responding to Gorsuch’s stated belief that justices have no partisan leanings, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) explained, “And you know, you said earlier, there are no Democratic judges, there are no Republican judges.	0
39hpo6	0	a	At the base of this argument was a simple question that has been dogging Democrats ever since the infamous Bush v. Gore decision on the 2000 presidential election: Is the Supreme Court rigged to benefit corporations, the wealthy and, well, Republicans?	0
39fox9	1	a	"Republicans panned the call as ""ridiculous."""	1
39hpo16	0	a	“We know, and we know and have seen, that the Supreme Court reshapes power in our country.”	0
39nyt5	0	a	Judge Gorsuch must earn the support of at least eight Democrats to break a filibuster — a threshold he is not on track to meet, at least so far, according to interviews and internal party discussions.	0
39nyt27	0	a	Mr. Casey is among the 10 Democrats facing re-election next year in states that Mr. Trump won.	0
39hpo7	0	a	Pressing this question did not knock Gorsuch off his steady stream of non-answers.	0
39fox19	0	a	McConnell hasn’t tipped his hand on strategy; however, he’s maintained in interviews that, one way or another, “the nominee will be confirmed.”	0
39nyt38	0	a	On Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch told the committee that the email had not been “my finest moment” and that he had been “blowing off steam with a friend, privately.”	0
39fox15	0	a	“If we end up with that gridlock, I would say, ‘If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,'” Trump said Feb. 1.	0
39fox12	0	a	"That's where the so-called ""nuclear option"" comes in."	0
39hpo8	0	a	The polished Gorsuch certainly did not make any deluded or deranged statements, as many have come to expect from the president, that could lead a Republican to flip on his nomination.	0
39hpo14	0	a	On this week’s episode of The Huffington Post’s “So That Happened” podcast, 2016 Democratic House candidate Zephyr Teachout, a constitutional law professor at Fordham University School of Law, said the Democrats took the right approach by aiming their fire at the court as an institution that shapes our economy and our politics.	0
39nyt8	0	a	Some Republicans have expressed reservations about changing the rules, but Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Thursday that he would relent if it meant seating Judge Gorsuch.	0
39fox18	0	a	“If they don’t find Gorsuch acceptable, are they taking the position the vacancy should never be filled? At all?”	0
39nyt1	0	a	As committee hearings on Judge Gorsuch concluded on Thursday, it appeared increasingly likely that Republicans hoping to elevate President Trump’s choice for the court would resort to replacing longstanding rules with a simple majority vote on his confirmation.	0
39hpo4	0	a	They made an argument against the Supreme Court itself and its false presentation as a body above politics and power.	0
39nyt10	0	a	Mr. McConnell has said he wants the Senate to confirm Judge Gorsuch to fill the vacancy, which was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia more than a year ago, before departing for a scheduled recess on April 7.	0
39fox3	0	a	Thune, who serves in the No. 3 position in Senate GOP leadership as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, added that Democrats “have not laid a glove on him” in the hearings and predicted the judge would get an “affirmative” vote in the Senate.	0
39hpo5	0	a	That judges do not, as Chief Justice John Roberts once famously said, only call “balls and strikes.”	0
39hpo36	0	a	After Gorsuch repeatedly stated that there was ample room for Congress to legislate without worrying about court decisions, Democrats reminded him of how the court’s decisions play a key role in shaping who is elected to Congress and, therefore, what bills can be passed in the first place.	0
39hpo23	0	a	Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) called this “an extraordinary blockade.” “It was totally unprecedented in our country’s whole history,” he added.	0

39hpo29	0	a	Instead, he went on to anchor the five vote conservative majority’s decisions in controversial cases.	0
39hpo35	0	a	The five vote conservative majority that included Scalia has sided with corporations and corporate lobby groups more than any other Supreme Court majority in recent history.	0

39nyt2	0	a	While a parade of witnesses addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, trading dueling views of Judge Gorsuch, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, went to the Senate floor and announced that he would try to lead Democrats in blocking an up-or-down vote on Judge Gorsuch.	0
39nyt16	0	a	That was particularly notable in light of studies that have shown the group has tended to favor the nominees of Democratic presidents.	0
39hpo42	0	a	Schumer added that he believed he had the 41 votes necessary to filibuster the nomination.	0
39hpo15	0	a	“I thought both Whitehouse and others rightly pointed out that after Roberts’ confirmation we gotta pull away that fake story that you’re just calling balls and strikes,” Teachout said.	0
39fox24	0	a	But the contentious Clarence Thomas hearing in 1991 produced a 52-48 split that just pushed Thomas over the finish line.	0

39fox5	0	a	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., both called Tuesday for a postponement on any vote to confirm Gorsuch to the nation’s highest court.	0

39nyt25	0	a	“I don’t think we should move forward on the Gorsuch nomination until the nomination of Merrick Garland has been dealt with fairly,” Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said on Thursday, signaling his support for a filibuster.	0
39fox11	0	a	That's a high bar for Republicans, who have just 52 members in the Senate.	0
39nyt31	0	a	Even before Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, Ms. McCaskill inadvertently drew the ire of liberal activists by expressing support for “a full confirmation hearing process and a vote,” before making clear she believed in a 60-vote threshold.	0
39nyt3	0	a	The Senate’s “cloture” rule requires a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome such a filibuster.	0
39hpo30	0	a	These included Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which opened the door to unlimited corporate spending in politics; Shelby County v. Holder, which overturned a key section of the voting rights act; and numerous pro-corporate decisions limiting the rights of citizens to challenge corporations in courts, reducing the ability of states to protect patient and privacy and allowing mutual funds to lie to investors.	0

39hpo13	0	a	Just let’s be sure that our Supreme Court doesn’t get to be one of those agencies that’s captured on any subject.”	0
39hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ― In recent years, the opposing party approached Supreme Court nomination hearings by honing in on the nominee’s character and temperament or on one particular case that could possibly derail the nominee.	0
39hpo20	0	a	Former President Barack Obama had nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia’s seat practically one year to the date before Gorsuch’s confirmation hearing.	0
39nyt24	0	a	The question facing Democrats is whether to have a filibuster fight over Judge Gorsuch, highlighting what they consider the theft of a seat they believe Mr. Obama had a right to fill, or whether to save that attention-grabbing tactic for a hypothetical future vacancy if a more liberal justice dies or steps down and President Trump nominates a staunch conservative who would shift the court’s balance.	0
39hpo28	0	a	In addition, Democrats are still irritated at Roberts for promising to call only “balls and strikes” in his 2005 confirmation hearing.	0
39nyt17	0	a	“We do not give the ‘well qualified’ rating lightly,” said Nancy Scott Degan, an official of the bar association.	0
39hpo10	0	a	Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) made this point abundantly clear when he pointed to the series of 5-4 decisions made under Roberts’ leadership that have changed laws to help Republicans get elected, big donors gain more influence in politics through campaign contributions and corporations gain more economic and political power.	0
39fox23	0	a	Antonin Scalia – whom Gorsuch would replace on the court following Scalia’s death in 2016 – was confirmed 98-0 and Anthony Kennedy had a tally of 97-0 in 1988.	0
39nyt20	0	a	Four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate and Republican senators were blockading Mr. Obama’s appeals court and executive branch nominees, Democrats changed the chamber’s rules to bar filibusters for such positions — but left the filibuster rule in place for Supreme Court nominations.	0

23hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON ― The House intelligence committee is preparing to issue subpoenas against Michael Flynn after the former national security adviser denied a request to voluntarily turn over documents related to the committee’s Russia probe.	0
23nyt8	0	a	Mr. Conaway has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of the investigation while it is continuing.	0
23fox0	0	a	The leaders of the Senate intelligence committee said Tuesday they had subpoenaed two of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's businesses as part of the ongoing probe into Russian activity during last year's presidential campaign.	0
23fox10	1	a	Everything but immunity, he added.	1
23nyt1	0	a	The Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said Mr. Flynn had declined the panel’s request for documents and an interview as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election.	0
23nyt15	0	a	Mr. Flynn’s legal troubles have only mounted in recent days.	0
23fox7	0	a	Intelligence committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said Tuesday that the panel also sent a letter to Flynn’s lawyer questioning whether his client can indeed invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid turning over documents.	0
23fox8	0	a	Burr added that if there is no response from Flynn, the committee may consider pursuing a contempt of Congress charge.	0
23hpo1	0	a	Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the committee, said on Wednesday that the committee is prepared to use “whatever compulsory process we need” to obtain information from Flynn if he does not cooperate with the subpoenas.	0
23nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The House Intelligence Committee will issue subpoenas to Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s first national security adviser, the committee’s senior Democrat said on Wednesday, escalating Mr. Flynn’s troubles with Congress.	0
23nyt10	0	a	On Monday, Mr. Flynn, in a letter from his legal team, rejected a subpoena for documents from the Senate committee, citing the Fifth Amendment’s protections against self-incrimination.	0
23hpo15	0	a	“There’s a legal standard that needs to be met for impeachment and then there’s a very practical standard that has to be met,” Schiff said.	0
23nyt16	0	a	On Monday, it was revealed that he had misled Pentagon investigators about his foreign contacts and sources of income while seeking a renewed security clearance in February 2016.	0
23hpo11	0	a	“That could be further evidence of an attempt to interfere with the investigation,” Schiff said of Trump’s reported request to Coats and Rogers.	0
23fox3	0	a	"""A business does not have the right to take the fifth,"" Warner told reporters."	0
23hpo5	0	a	The House committee’s subpoenas “will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Schiff told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.	0
23nyt20	0	a	As recently as Monday, in his letter to the Senate committee, Mr. Flynn has reiterated his offer to testify in exchange for immunity from prosecution.	0
23hpo9	0	a	Trump implied earlier this month that he had “tapes” of discussions with recently fired FBI Director James Comey that would be damaging to Comey.	0
23hpo17	0	a	“If the Republicans in Congress or people at large in the country feel this is simply a way to nullify an election that others didn’t agree with, then you’re not going to meet the practical standards necessary,” Schiff said.	0
23hpo10	0	a	And the Washington Post reported earlier this week that Trump asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers to push back on the FBI’s Russia investigation.	0
23nyt4	0	a	Mr. Schiff said he hoped the committee would issue the subpoenas this week, before Congress leaves for a one-week recess.	0
23hpo2	0	a	He added that the committee could issue additional subpoenas if other witnesses fail to cooperate, but did not name additional individuals.	0
23nyt14	0	a	He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence.	0
23fox5	0	a	Trump fired Flynn in February because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador about potentially easing economic sanctions.	0
23hpo13	0	a	“If all of this is part of a pattern by the White House of interference or worse, that’s something that we have to find out about and it’s something we have to stop,” he said.	0
23nyt18	0	a	During that trip, he was photographed at a gala sitting next to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.	0
23nyt3	0	a	“And I think we need to use whatever compulsory methods are necessary to get the information that he possesses.”	0
23nyt5	0	a	It was unclear whether the subpoenas would seek documents or Mr. Flynn’s testimony, or both.	0
23hpo3	0	a	Citing the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Flynn’s lawyer said on Monday that Flynn would not comply with subpoenas from the Senate intelligence committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into Russia’s interference in the election and whether it colluded with President Donald Trump’s associates.	0
23hpo8	0	a	The committee is also looking for ways to obtain documentation of Trump’s conversations with top intelligence and law enforcement officials involved in a separate federal Russia probe.	0
23fox9	0	a	"""Everything is on the table,"" Burr said."	0
23hpo6	0	a	“We need to use whatever compulsory mechanism necessary to get the information he possesses … the Fifth Amendment right not to provide materials or documents is limited,” he added.	0
23hpo16	0	a	Practically speaking, he continued, impeachment is only possible if Republican lawmakers and the general public believe Trump is unfit for office.	0
23nyt21	0	a	Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the committee, has dismissed that option.	0
23hpo14	0	a	Despite concerns about Trump interfering with ongoing investigations into his campaign, Schiff warned that it is premature for Democrats on Capitol Hill to push for impeachment.	0
23hpo4	0	a	The Senate committee responded with two additional subpoenas on Tuesday targeting Flynn’s businesses.	0
23nyt12	1	a	Mr. Flynn’s rejection of the subpoena put him at risk of being held in contempt of Congress, a rarely invoked process that, should lawmakers choose to pursue it, could result in a criminal citation.	1
23nyt6	0	a	The subpoenas could not be issued without at least some support from Republicans, who make up the majority of the committee.	0
23nyt9	0	a	The announcement was made mere hours after the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday afternoon to Mr. Flynn’s two firms, seeking information that could shed light on his lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests last year, among other connections.	0
23nyt2	0	a	“Those subpoenas will be designed to maximize our chance of getting the information that we need,” Mr. Schiff told reporters during a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.	0
23nyt13	0	a	The Flynn Intel Group was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign.	0
23hpo12	0	a	He also referred to past reports that the White House asked allies on Capitol Hill to refute negative press stories about Trump associates’ ties to Russia.	0
23nyt7	0	a	A spokeswoman for Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the investigation, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	0
23fox4	0	a	The investigation focuses on whether Flynn and other Trump associates colluded with Russia to boost the Republican candidate in the 2016 elections.	0
23nyt19	0	a	Lying to federal officials is a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison.	0
23fox2	0	a	The committee's action comes a day after Flynn’s lawyer notified the committee that his client will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not comply with the committee’s subpoena seeking documents related to its investigation.	0
23nyt11	0	a	He also declined the Senate committee’s invitation for an interview.	0
23hpo7	0	a	Schiff said he is “skeptical” that the committee would agree to grant Flynn immunity in the future in exchange for information.	0
23fox6	0	a	Flynn is also being investigated over whether he was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.	0
36fox3	0	a	Gowdy said Friday that Clinton, the presumptive Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, has yet to adequately respond to the subpoena request for the server.	0
36nyt29	0	a	“We should keep our conclusions and speculation to a minimum and follow the facts.”	0
36nyt18	0	a	Mr. Gowdy has sought to prevent his inquiry into the attacks in 2012 on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya — and its burgeoning examination of Mrs. Clinton’s email practices — from being dismissed as a strictly partisan effort to embarrass a likely Democratic nominee for president.	0
36nyt2	0	a	He added that Mrs. Clinton’s disclosure last week that all of the emails from the personal account had been deleted “only exacerbates our need to better understand what the secretary did, when she did it and why she did it.”	0
36fox11	0	a	He also suggested on the show and in the letter that efforts to get Clinton to comply with the requests might require the full weight of the Republican-led House and that he will confer with House Speaker John Boehner about whether another committee will be involved.	0
36nyt19	0	a	But the time frame in which he is asking Mrs. Clinton to submit to questioning — at any time before May 1 — coincides with the period in which she is widely expected to make her candidacy official.	0
36nyt15	0	a	“To be clear, she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the American public.”	0
36nyt1	0	a	Mrs. Clinton’s “email arrangement with herself is highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” the committee’s chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton’s lawyer Tuesday morning.	0
36nyt25	0	a	In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy said Mr. Priebus had overstepped his expertise.	0
36fox10	0	a	"""I need to ask what she did (with the server) and when she did it and importantly why she did it,” he said on Fox News' ""On the Record with Greta Van Susteren."""	0
36hpo4	0	a	An interview, Gowdy argued, would provide protection for the likely 2016 presidential candidate’s privacy and security for sensitive information.	0
36hpo10	1	a	Gowdy went on to call Clinton’s email situation “highly unusual, if not unprecedented,” and said it “exacerbates” lawmakers’ needs to “understand what the Secretary did.”	1
36hpo11	1	a	Earlier this month, Clinton said she had a private email account because she “thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two.”	1
36nyt24	0	a	“There are thousands and thousands of emails that are missing.”	0
36nyt26	1	a	“As far as I know, he’s not an expert in federal record-keeping law,” Mr. Gowdy said of Mr. Priebus.	1
36nyt28	0	a	“We don’t know enough facts, so why speculate?” Mr. Gowdy added.	0
36nyt23	1	a	“Even Nixon didn’t destroy the tapes,” Mr. Priebus said, referring to the Watergate scandal that ultimately led to President Richard M. Nixon’s resignation.	1
36nyt0	0	a	WASHINGTON — The chairman of the House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks asked Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday to appear for a private interview about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state.	0
36fox4	1	a	He said the committee learned she had “unilaterally decided” to wipe it clean and permanently delete all emails.	1
36nyt16	0	a	The committee’s ranking member, Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said the panel should hold a public hearing instead of a private interview.	0
36fox0	0	a	"The congressional committee probing the Benghazi attacks has formally requested that Hillary Clinton appear for an interview on her use of a personal email and server for official business while secretary of state, after learning the server had been wiped ""clean."""	0
36nyt4	0	a	But in a letter to Mr. Gowdy on Friday, a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton said there was no need to turn over the server because an examination of it showed that it had no copies of emails she sent during her time as secretary of state.	0
36hpo2	0	a	“Toward that end and because of the Secretary’s unique arrangement with herself as it relates to public records during and after her tenure as Secretary of State, this Committee is left with no alternative but to request Secretary Clinton appear before this Committee for a transcribed interview to better understand decisions the Secretary made relevant to the creation, maintenance, retention, and ultimately deletion of public records,” Gowdy stated in the letter.	0
36fox6	0	a	Earlier this month, Clinton acknowledged that she sent or received roughly 60,000 related emails, turning over roughly half to the State Department and deleting about the same number of “personal” ones.	0
36nyt11	0	a	Mr. Gowdy said the committee believed that “a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it.”	0
36nyt6	0	a	The lawyer for Mrs. Clinton, David Kendall, said that in response to that request, Mrs. Clinton’s representatives had determined which of her roughly 60,000 emails were personal and private.	0
36hpo13	0	a	Clinton is not the only government official to use a private email for work.	0
36fox9	0	a	"Gowdy suggested Monday that he wants to have ""separate conversations"" with Clinton about Benghazi and the emails, in light of her wiping clean the server."	0
36nyt20	0	a	Some Republicans on Capitol Hill — including Mr. Gowdy — are growing frustrated with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who they contend is politicizing the email issue.	0
36nyt13	0	a	In a written statement, a spokesman for her said she had told the committee months ago that she was prepared to testify at a public hearing.	0
36hpo7	0	a	Gowdy said once Clinton is interviewed and all documents related to the 2012 Benghazi attack are shared, the committee will schedule a time for Clinton to testify publicly in a hearing.	0
36fox8	0	a	“The committee believes a transcribed interview would best protect Secretary Clinton’s privacy, the security of the information queried, and the public’s interest in ensuring this committee has all information needed to accomplish the task set before it,” Gowdy also wrote in the letter.	0
36fox2	0	a	"Gowdy asked that Clinton agree to a ""transcribed"" interview -- and repeated a March 16 request for her to surrender her server so it can be examined by the State Department’s inspector general."	0
36hpo0	0	a	WASHINGTON -- The House Select Committee on Benghazi sent a formal interview request to Hillary Clinton’s lawyer on Tuesday regarding emails she exchanged during her time as secretary of state.	0
36nyt3	0	a	The emails were on a server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y. Mr. Gowdy had asked Mrs. Clinton to turn over that server to a neutral third party, like the State Department’s inspector general, to determine which emails were personal and which were government records.	0
36fox12	0	a	Clinton has not yet announced a presidential bid.	0
36hpo12	1	a	She admitted that “looking back,” it would have been better to carry the second phone.	1
36nyt21	1	a	On Monday, Mr. Priebus said in an appearance on Fox News that Mrs. Clinton’s decision to delete her emails “is criminal in nature.”	1
36nyt27	1	a	“And I’m 100 percent positive he is not a member of the executive branch, which is charged with investigating and prosecuting under the law.”	1
36hpo8	0	a	“We share the Secretary’s desire these two conversations take place as quickly and efficiently as possible, and are willing to expedite both working with your office, the Secretary’s schedule and our Democrat colleagues on the Committee,” Gowdy said.	0
36nyt17	0	a	“Rather than drag out this political charade into 2016 and selectively leak portions of a closed-door interview, the committee should schedule the public hearing, make her records public and refocus its efforts on the attacks in Benghazi,” he said.	0
36hpo6	0	a	Last week, Gowdy said Clinton did not respond to any of the subpoenas requesting documents in the case, and her lawyer had informed the committee that the server used for emails during her tenure had been wiped clean.	0
36hpo3	0	a	Gowdy set a May 1 deadline for the interview.	0
36nyt8	1	a	Since the report by The New York Times on March 2 that Mrs. Clinton used only a personal email account and did not even have a government account, she seems to have provided two answers about whether she still has copies of her emails.	1
36fox1	0	a	Committee Chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., made the request in a letter sent Tuesday to Clinton's lawyer.	0
36nyt22	0	a	“I mean, you cannot just destroy documents when an agency is telling you to turn them over,” Mr. Priebus said on “Fox and Friends.”	0
36nyt10	0	a	But she then said that the server, which contained personal communications of her husband, former President Bill Clinton, “will remain private.”	0
36fox7	0	a	The South Carolina Republican set a deadline of May 1 for the interview and restated the committee is interested only in the deleted emails relating to Clinton’s response as secretary of state to the 2012 terror attacks on a U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed.	0
36hpo1	0	a	In a letter to the Clinton’s lawyer, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the committee chairman, said the committee is not interested in emails relating to personal or private matters, and instead will focus solely on those pertaining to “Libya and Benghazi during the relevant time periods.”	0
