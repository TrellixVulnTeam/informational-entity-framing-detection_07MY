broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.", "And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.", "In the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.", "\u201cThat is our plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "Noting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make.", "The proposal was Mr. Trump\u2019s first public offer to

immigration.", "\u201cThis puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.\u201d", "But the proposal, which Mr. Trump unveiled in a 13-minute address from the White House, appeared dead on arrival in the Capitol.", "Some on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty.", "But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.", "In casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats \u2014 who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any
